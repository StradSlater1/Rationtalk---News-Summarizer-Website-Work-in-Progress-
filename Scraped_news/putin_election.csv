The other candidates — all members of the State Duma, Russia’s rubber-stamp Parliament — voted for the war in Ukraine, for increased censorship and for laws curbing gay rights.', 'Nikolai Kharitonov, 75, of the Communist Party, already lost badly to Mr. Putin in 2004.', 'Leonid Slutsky, 56 of the Liberal Democratic Party, a nationalist group loyal to Mr. Putin, has said he will not rally voters against the president.', 'Vladislav A. Davankov, 40, from the New People Party, is nominally liberal and has called for “peace” in Ukraine but has basically supported Mr. Putin.', 'Two candidates opposed to the war were disqualified. A veteran politician, Boris Nadezhdin, alarmed the Putin administration when tens of thousands of people across Russia lined up to sign petitions required for him to run. The Kremlin invalidated enough signatures to bar him.', 'Russia held real elections for about a decade after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Ever since, the Kremlin has relied on various social, geographic and technical levers to ensure that its candidate receives an overwhelming majority.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Although Mr. Putin enjoys some support, the Kremlin has long sought to proclaim that he received more than 50 percent support in balloting, and also more support than he did in each previous vote. This year that means outstripping the 56 million votes that the authorities said he received in 2018; pundits are betting on 60 million.', 'Two important changes this time could add to the vote’s opacity.', 'For one, balloting will be held in the so-called “new territories,” the four Ukrainian regions Moscow annexed without fully controlling them. Russia’s election officials say the area has 4.5 million voters, an assertion virtually impossible to monitor amid a war.', '“We cannot check the figures there and the authorities will use them as they wish,” said Alexander V. Kynev, an independent election expert in Moscow.', 'Also, the ability to vote online will be more widely available, with electronic voters in 29 regions on one huge list, with no means to check where or how they voted, Mr. Kynev noted.', 'In a sprawling, diverse country like Russia, the Kremlin can also use more traditional means. Regions dominated by ethnic strongmen, like the Caucasus, habitually report huge turnouts with Mr. Putin receiving 99 percent of the vote — even if relatively few people show up at polling stations.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Areas where state industries prevail also tend to report heavy support for the president. To turn out the vote, some polling stations hold raffles for prizes like household appliances or firewood. One Siberian region is offering 16,000 prizes.', 'But the Kremlin must rely on some votes in big cities, and that can get tricky. Excessive manipulation has created unrest previously. There might be slightly more manipulation this year because monitors are barred unless issued credentials by the candidates.', 'With street demonstrations banned, some Putin opponents hope to cast protest votes. The simplest method to lower his tally is to vote for someone else, experts noted.', '“Noon Against Putin,” a campaign pushed by Mr. Navalny’s organization, suggests swarming polling places at midday on Sunday. But there are a number of hurdles, including possible confrontations with the police.', 'Also, in previous votes, few polling stations had more than 3,000 registered voters and many had fewer than 1,000. “It is technically very complicated to create a crowd,” said David Kankiia, an analyst with the Golos election watchdog, barred in Russia.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Since he was first appointed successor to President Boris Yeltsin in 2000, Mr. Putin has said Russia’s Constitution would dictate the length of his tenure. Then he kept rewriting the Constitution.', 'Asked in 2014 whether he would remain president forever, Mr. Putin responded, “This is not good and it is detrimental for the country and I do not need it either,” before adding, “We will see what the situation will be like, but in any case the term of my work is restricted by the Constitution.”', 'In 2008, when term limits forced him to step aside, he became prime minister under President Dmitri A. Medvedev, although Mr. Putin remained the power behind the throne until reclaiming the top job in 2012.', 'Presidential terms were extended to six years before the 2018 vote, and then in 2020 Mr. Putin changed the constitution again to reset his term clock. At this point, he can have at least two terms until 2036.

What will that mean for his country and the West?', 'POLITICO illustration; Photos by AP, Getty Images', 'By CASEY MICHEL', '03/16/2024 07:00 AM EDT', '', 'Casey Michel is author of the forthcoming book Foreign Agents: How American Lobbyists and Lawmakers Threaten Democracy Around the World, and is currently the director of the Human Rights Foundation’s Combating Kleptocracy Program.', 'This weekend, Vladimir Putin will win another election as Russia’s president. The election will, of course, be rigged in Putin’s favor, just as all of his past elections have been, but Putin is all but assured to claim another six-year term, taking him to at least 2030.', 'Yet for all that inevitability, Putin’s next term as president has been the focus of surprisingly little discussion, including what it is likely to mean both inside and outside Russia. And that’s all the more surprising given that Putin’s regime is arguably more destabilized now than it’s ever been, with little end in sight for Russia’s growing economic troubles or the spiraling deaths on the battlefields of Ukraine. Since last summer alone, Russia has seen a sudden mutiny, led by a renegade militia that nearly marched on Moscow; rampaging anti-Semitic riots, with security services nowhere to be found; and protests erupt in normally placid places like Bashkortostan.', 'No one can say what these events portend. But it’s clear that the war in Ukraine has helped make Russia’s domestic situation more unstable than it’s been in decades, and all kinds of potential future scenarios are no longer unthinkable.', 'So it’s a good time to think about them. In at least considering the paths below — and the likelihood of their arrival in the not-too-distant future — the West can begin preparing accordingly, especially in terms of strategy and policy. We know much about Russia’s past and plenty about Russia’s present. But what about Russia’s future?', 'Below are five scenarios that Russia might (or might not) experience by the end of Putin’s next term in 2030.', 'While Alexei Navalny may have been the most prominent leader of democratic movements in Russia, killing him will hardly eliminate pro-democratic energies in the country. | Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images', 'Why It Might Happen: As the anti-communist, anti-colonial revolutions in 1989 across Eastern Europe illustrated, totalitarian regimes can rest on quicksand and quickly crumble in the face of democratic movements. Putin’s disastrous decision-making in Ukraine has already had unforeseen knock-on effects, which will only continue to generate discontent moving forward — and more interest in potential alternatives, including outright democracy.', 'And that was true even before Alexei Navalny’s suspicious death in prison. While Navalny may have been the most prominent leader of democratic movements in Russia, killing him has hardly eliminated pro-democratic energies in the country. With Navalny transformed from a campaigner into a martyr, such momentum for democratic reform — even democratic revolution — might actually begin building anew. As a prisoner, Navalny was out of sight, and largely out of mind for most Russians. But as a symbol of the lengths Putin’s regime will go to snuff out any opposition, Navalny may now become something more.', 'Combined with the other protests still gurgling around Russia, not least those organized by soldiers’ mothers and wives, a sudden burst of democratic momentum around the country is now possible. Nothing would be more of a testament to Navalny’s life, and to Navalny’s legacy.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: As much as many in the West would like to see a full flourishing of democracy in Russia — whether led by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, or someone else — the likelihood of such a scenario playing out before 2030 is minimal. And that was the case even before Navalny’s death. Now, with the leader of Russian democratic hopes suddenly snuffed out, any chance at rallying Russians to a democratic cause has almost certainly died with him, at least for the foreseeable future.', 'Just look at where Russia is. Navalny is, in many ways, irreplaceable, just as jailed pro-democratic figures like Vaclav Havel or Nelson Mandela before him were irreplaceable, and whose countries’ democratic transformations happened only after they were freed. The rest of Navalny’s pro-democracy infrastructure has been effectively undone, stamped out by Putin’s repression. And even with the shock of Navalny’s death still settling, the Russian body politic has hardly evinced any interest in liberal democracy anyway. Rather than rallying to his cause, many have simply shrugged their shoulders at Navalny’s demise, and gone on with their lives. The same goes for hopes of rising opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; even two years into Putin’s disastrous war, the majority of Russians are still passively, if not actively, supportive of the unprovoked invasion.', 'What the West Should Do: The best hopes for a democratic Russia lie, perhaps ironically, not in Russia itself, but in Ukraine. Just as colonial failures in places like Angola and Algeria led to democratic, post-imperial reforms in places like Portugal and France, so too could a Ukrainian victory kill off Russian nationalism and Russian revanchism — and finally spur the kind of democratic flourishing Navalny called for.', 'If this scenario does come to pass, it’s incumbent on the West to return to an old strategic staple: trust, but verify. Don’t get overexcited about Russia’s democratic prospects — a mistake far too many in the West made in the 1990s — but encourage what you can. Be open to lifting sanctions and hydrocarbon price caps, but only in return for concrete reforms and prosecutions of Putin-era officials. All the while, keep building out relations with Russia’s neighbors and former colonies, places like Moldova and Armenia.', 'Perhaps above all else — and as sacrilegious as it may sound right now — don’t put your hopes in a single leader. Navalny was the clear lodestar for Russian democratic hopes, but even he had his nationalist weaknesses, claiming, for instance, that Crimea is rightfully Russian. If nothing else, Navalny should be the last singular Russian figure so many in the West place hopes of democratic reform on — a belief that has burned the West in the past and that led the West to miss just how ingrained Russian imperialism still is.', 'A Dagestan officer kicks the body of a Chechen fighter in the village of Pervomaiskaya after the Russian grueling assault on Jan. 19, 1996. | Serguey Chirikov/AFP via Getty Images', 'Why It Might Happen: Picture this: on the back of a devastating war, with hundreds of thousands of Moscow’s troops slaughtered in a meaningless fight, Russians turn out to protest en masse, and overthrow an aging, doddering regime. Long-buried frictions and frustrations ripple across the country and a nation supposedly united under the steady hand of Moscow suddenly splinters along ethnonationalist lines. Chaos sprints across the nation, which collapses into a mixture of anarchy, territorial fragmentation, and violence that leaves no region, and no family, untouched.', 'Sound farfetched? Think again. This is, after all, precisely what happened in Russia in the late 1910s and early 1920s, when the tsarist collapse ripped apart the Russian Empire, with peoples and polities across Eastern Europe and the Caucasus and northern Asia all declaring independence — only for most to eventually be gobbled up by a rising Soviet regime.', 'This is also what we saw following the Soviet collapse (albeit with far less violence), when new nations claimed their sovereignty following the USSR’s collapse — and not just in places like Ukraine or Kazakhstan. Residents in Chechnya voted for clear independence, while those in Tatarstan voted for equal footing with the Russian Federation. Residents in places like the Siberian nation of Sakha signed agreements for an independent army, while residents in the Buddhist nation of Tuva unleashed anti-Russian violence that bordered on outright pogroms. State fracture — and independence for nations long colonized by Moscow, but still largely unfamiliar to the West — stalked the Russian Federation.', 'Could it happen again? Perhaps not immediately. But Russia remains a conglomerate of 21 republics, dozens more regions, and even more nationalities with uncountable grievances against Moscow. The longer the war continues — and the more these colonized minorities are tossed into Putin’s meat grinder, slaughtered at far higher rates than ethnic Russians — the likelihood of such a scenario increases. Perhaps in the republic of Chechnya, its leader — an increasingly unhealthy Ramzan Kadyrov — dies in office and infighting over a successor spirals into a third Chechen War. Perhaps in Muslim-majority Tatarstan, veterans’ committees and local students gather to protest both Moscow’s recruitment of Tatar infantry and smothering of Tatar identity — and the Kremlin, in a fit of failed strategy, opens fire on the protesters, sparking a broader anti-colonial movement. Or perhaps, in Sakha, the unemployed storm and seize control of Russian hydrocarbon infrastructure, demanding the funds be returned to their colonized nation, and demanding the sovereignty they agreed to in the early 1990s.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: Many Russian analysts still view this scenario as farfetched, given Putin’s grip on power. And they’re not necessarily wrong; aside from Chechnya, no clear thirst for outright independence is evident, even in those nations watching their men be massacred in Ukraine. Recent protests in places like Dagestan and Bashkortostan, for instance, weren’t solely about independence but included economic and environmental grievances as well.', 'Still, dismissing this scenario out of hand would be unwise. All it takes is a spark, and the tinder that Putin has built up over his quarter-century in power could go up in flames — a likelihood that only grows alongside Putin’s disaster in Ukraine.', 'What the West Should Do: The West should stay flexible and remain mindful that the Russian Federation is hardly a homogenous entity. It should encourage democratic forces around the country, including in those that emerge in nations long colonized by Moscow, while training far more speakers of languages like Chechen, Sakha and Tatar. It should also lean on those who successfully safeguarded the Soviet Union’s nuclear arsenal during the Soviet collapse, making sure their expertise is implemented yet again. And it should prepare to be comfortable with territorial reorganization across the Russian Federation — a country that still refuses to recognize its own colonial legacies, which are only going to become more trenchant as the years pass.', 'While Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group never quite reached Moscow, that wasn’t for lack of opportunity; if anything, the path was wide open. | Vasily Deryugin/Kommersant Publishing House via AP', 'Why It Might Happen: A year ago, the idea that a renegade militia led by a frothing nationalist could nearly march on Moscow, sending Russian officials scurrying for cover, was fantasy. Not that it hadn’t been done before; the so-called “Kornilov Affair” of 1917, and even the failed hardliner coup of 1991, showed what a move could potentially look like. But under Putin, the idea that Russian nationalists might congeal and storm Moscow long seemed laughable.', 'And then, last June, militia head Yevgeny Prigozhin did just that. And while Prigozhin’s Wagner Group never quite reached Moscow, that wasn’t for lack of opportunity; if anything, the path was wide open. If Prigozhin accomplished anything, it was that he made Putin look like a tsar with no clothes.', 'Of course, Prigozhin is no longer around — his plane exploded over Russian airspace a few months later, killing him and much of his inner circle in what is widely assumed to be Putin’s retribution. But all of the ingredients that fueled Prigozhin’s rebellion are still there: frustration with Putin’s bungled invasion; the ongoing stripping of Russia of men and material in order to continue a quagmire; and the kind of spiraling wealth inequality that’s launched populists and revolutionaries around the world before.', 'For those reasons, this appears to be one of the likelier scenarios facing a post-Putin Russia. The flames of nationalism, stoked by Putin, will hardly subside anytime soon.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: Still, a scenario like this is hardly inevitable. Prigozhin himself was almost one-of-a-kind — a chef-turned-oligarch willing to publicly break with Putin’s cabinet, and even insult the president himself, all while building out a globe-spanning militia from Ukraine to central Africa. At the moment, there’s no other force that can compare to Prigozhin’s Wagner Group, much of which has been dismantled and subsumed by the state.', 'Plus, if anything, Putin is only getting more nationalistic as the war drags on, leaning further and further into outright fascism. Outflanking Putin from the right is only going to get more difficult, especially as he continues descending into the world of nationalistic conspiracies.', 'Want to read more stories like this? POLITICO Weekend delivers gripping reads, smart analysis and a bit of high-minded fun every Friday. Sign up for the newsletter.', 'What the West Should Do: If and when a more nationalistic figure or cadre replaces Putin, the West should continue to strengthen and expand sanctions, lower the hydrocarbon price caps, build out diplomatic and security relations with Russia’s neighbors, especially those (like Ukraine) directly targeted by Russian nationalists — all of it part of a broader package of policies. Call it, if you will, containment — a policy that helped hem in Soviet expansionism and could once more help to rein in an expansionist Moscow.', 'Smoke rises from a building in Bakhmut, site of the heaviest battles with the Russian troops in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. | Libkos/AP', 'Why it might happen: We’re now two years into Moscow’s failed invasion of Ukraine, and the impact in Russia is already obvious. And those costs, whether in terms of a sagging economy or spiraling body counts, will continue piling up. Which is why the idea of an inner circle of Kremlin officials meeting with Putin and informing him that they appreciate his service, and that they wish him well in retirement — a redux of Nikita Khrushchev’s 1964 ouster, in other words — is a scenario only rising in likelihood as time goes on.', 'Indeed, there’s a distinct likelihood that by 2030, a new regime will emerge in Russia. (Not that it needs to lead an internal conspiracy against Putin; the aging dictator could, of course, just die in office, and save us all the trouble.) The new government wouldn’t be democratic, necessarily. But it would be headed by a small number of Western-trained, technocratic elites, who would start out saying many of the things Western officials and businessmen, eager to get back to a kind of status quo antebellum, love to hear. They would put much of the blame for the war on Putin alone, promising a return to a sense of normalcy in Moscow. They might go so far as to free certain political prisoners and opposition politicians, or even rescind Putin’s 2022 announcement of annexations in eastern Ukraine (though not Crimea).', 'All the while, they would call for something that many Western politicians would welcome: “reset.” A chance to start over. To start fresh. And to pledge a new Russia moving forward.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: With apologies to Isaac Newton, there’s an iron law of authoritarianism: a dictator in power tends to stay in power. In other words, wresting control from a dictator like Putin always requires significantly more planning, energy and resources than the incumbent leader needs to thwart any internal conspiracy. It’s not that surprising, when you think about it, given that a dictator like Putin still holds all the levers of the state — and cultivates competition among his underlings, who would be eager to rat out any anti-Putin plotting. Toss in the fact that Putin still appears to have wide support among Russian officialdom — not least because, given the state of the war in Ukraine, Russia might actually win — and hopes of a Khrushchev-style ouster are hardly a safe bet.', 'What the West Should Do: If this actually were to happen — if a new, technocratic elite manages to wrest control from Putin — the West’s policy formula should be a flip of the strategy for actual democratic transition. That is, the West must distrust, but verify. If nothing else, Western officials should remember that every time a “reset” approach with Russia has been pursued, the West ended up appearing foolish, myopic, or both. For that reason, any calls for a renewed “reset” should be treated with severe skepticism. And while democratic reforms should obviously be encouraged and incentivized — especially as it pertains to lifting restrictions on civil society or Russia paying reparations for Ukraine — any improvements should be treated as temporary. After all, we’ve seen this story before, and we’ve seen how, time and again, it ends.', 'Vladimir Putin’s grip on power still appears strong — but there are plenty of factors that will make his next term far different, and potentially far more difficult, than anything he’s seen previously. | Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images', 'Why It Might Happen: This was always going to be the likeliest scenario, wasn’t it? Barring unforeseen health events, and especially given the U.S.’s newfound squeamishness on backing Ukraine, Putin can look at his new presidential term as something that he will likely serve out entirely, and potentially far beyond.', 'And understandably so. With the death of Navalny, the democratic opposition is in shambles. The Russian economy, despite a barrage of Western sanctions, has hardly collapsed, even if it’s turned sluggish. Although Putin hasn’t conquered Kyiv, the worst of the Ukrainian war may yet be behind him, especially given the U.S.’s reticence to arm Ukraine. And compared to American presidents, at just 71, Putin’s still got (relative) youth on his side.', 'He’s already become one of Russia’s longest ruling leaders, with plenty of presidential terms behind him. Looking ahead to 2030, why would anything change?', 'Why It Might Not Happen: Putin’s grip on power still appears strong — but there are plenty of factors that will make his next term far different, and potentially far more difficult, than anything he’s seen previously. Take the economy. While Putin’s managed to ride out the sanctions against Russia thus far, the economy as a whole is clearly heading for both stagnation and rising inflation. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Putin’s missteps have already resulted in staggering casualty numbers. Either ingredient would be enough to threaten any leader, no matter how authoritarian. Escaping the vise of both is going to stretch Putin’s dictatorial toolkit further than ever before.', 'What the West Should Do: Ratchet up the pressure, wherever and however it can. Continue and enhance the sanctions, including against third parties in places like the United Arab Emirates that are helping Moscow skirt sanctions. Strengthen the hydrocarbon price caps, which have already drained revenue to the Russian state, and seize outright all of the frozen Russian Central Bank assets. Deepen partnerships with those on Russia’s periphery, especially as it pertains to encouraging democratic developments.', 'And, perhaps most of all, recognize that so long as Putin remains in power, Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine will continue, with threats of far broader warfare hanging in the offing. The West should use every tool it can find to force Russians — both those in the Kremlin and the broader populace itself — to realize how much better off they, and the rest of us, will be when Putin is no longer in power.', 'Gripping reads, smart analysis and a bit of high-minded fun.

Official results say he received 87% of the vote, which is the highest margin of any presidential election in Russia. What he will do with that enormous influence is the subject of much speculation now.', 'TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — To no one’s surprise, President Vladimir Putin secured another six years in power in a preordained election landslide that comes amid the harshest crackdown on the opposition and\u202ffree speech since Soviet times.', 'The three days of balloting, in which Putin faced three token contenders but none offering voters any real choice, went ahead with barely any independent monitoring and were marked by a level of pressure unseen in previous Russian elections. That left little room for protests, but some Russians still tried to defy authorities.', 'Some key takeaways from the election:', 'The Central Election Commission said Putin received 87.28% of the vote, the highest number for any president in post-Soviet Russia. It said turnout was 77.44% of the electorate, also the biggest. Others on the ballot all finished in single digits, and anti-war candidates were not allowed to run.', 'The state news agency RIA Novosti said the vote “as expected ... took place in an atmosphere of unprecedented national unity.”', 'There was no video from CCTV cameras at polling stations depicting voter fraud or ballot-box stuffing -– access to the footage was more heavily restricted than in previous elections -– and hardly any independent monitors were on hand to document irregularities.', 'There still was voter intimidation, however, according to Golos, Russia’s prominent independent election watchdog, noting it received reports of citizens being pressured to vote in over 60 Russian regions. On Sunday, voters were searched at polling stations, and some reported police checking their ballots before they were cast or peering over their shoulder while they filled them out, Golos said.', '', '“Nothing like that has happened on such a scale at elections in Russia before,” Golos said in a statement Monday. A total of 89 people were detained Sunday in 22 cities, said OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests.', 'The 71-year-old Russia leader “chose to show his adversaries his power,” said political analyst Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin’s speechwriter.', 'Vandalism also was reported at polling stations, with arson attempts or some pouring ink into ballot boxes. On Sunday, a woman who set off a firecracker in a polling station bathroom was injured. At least 34 people were detained on vandalism charges over the weekend, according to Russian independent news outlet Verstka.', 'The Kremlin has severely crippled the Russian opposition in recent years. Top figures are either in jail or in exile abroad, and the death last month of Alexei Navalny, who was Putin’s most vocal opponent, raised even more questions about what lies ahead for them.', 'On Sunday, some Russians turned up at polling stations at home and abroad at noon local time and formed long lines in a strategy endorsed by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny and other Putin adversaries.', 'Analysts had said the “Noon Against Putin” tactic would test how well exiled opposition figures could rally supporters amid the crackdown that has largely scared people off from staging mass demonstrations.', 'Its success was hard to gauge. Navalny’s team shared photos of lines at polling stations in Russia and embassies abroad as proof that many heeded their call.

Putin won the contest with over 87 percent of the vote, with a reported 77 percent turnout. The record post-Soviet win was Putin’s choreographed attempt to demonstrate his popularity — and that of the war in Ukraine. But it is impossible to take much away, given the level of repression in Russian society and Putin’s ambition to make himself synonymous with the Russian state.', 'The results come just a month after the death of Putin’s most potent and vocal foe, the anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, while he was serving a 19-year sentence in an Arctic penal colony on multiple charges including extremism. It’s also a little over two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Russia refers to as a “special military operation.” Western countries have backed Ukraine during the grueling two-year war and imposed heavy sanctions on Russia, but those efforts have done little to loosen Putin’s grip on power; on the contrary, Putin’s government is at its most repressive since he first took power in 2000.', 'Even before his fifth term starts, Putin will already be the longest-serving Russian leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. If he serves out the entirety of this six-year term, he will surpass Stalin and be in the running next with Catherine the Great and then perhaps eventually Peter the Great — two rulers whose imperial power Putin has sought to mimic in his conquest of Ukraine and other former Soviet and imperial lands.', 'With his reelection, Putin will be in power till at least 2030, unless he dies or is somehow removed from power in the intervening six years.', 'Putin’s ruthless quest to build power — not only his own, but Russia’s — might come as a surprise to anyone who saw him when he first became president in 2000.', 'An unknown, unmemorable bureaucrat from St. Petersburg who served in the Soviet spy agency in Dresden during the tail end of the Cold War, Putin hardly seemed poised to gain the near-total power he now has in Russia.', 'But through a combination of immense wealth, cronyism, fraud, increasingly cruel repression, and constant information warfare, Putin has consolidated his power over the past 24 years, even when his deputy Dmitry Medvedev was nominally in charge.', 'Putin came into incredible wealth following the collapse of the Soviet Union and was appointed acting president in 1999 after Boris Yeltsin resigned. He was officially elected in 2000, serving his constitutionally mandated two terms — and even seemed more willing to cooperate with the West during that time. But he was also displaying imperial ambitions, fighting wars in Chechnya and Georgia.', 'After Medvedev pushed through a constitutional change allowing additional presidential terms, Putin regained the presidency in 2012. Amid the most fervent protests against the autocratic and corrupt regime, his government began instituting and escalating brutal crackdowns on minority groups like the LGBTQ population, opposition members, and civil society to entrench a narrative of Russian tradition.', '“In the 1990s–2000s, Russia experienced a range of issues such as economic and demographic crises and the loss of its impactful role on the international stage, causing the perceived ‘emasculation’ of the population,” Radzhana Buyantueva, a researcher studying LGBTQ communities in Russia and their intersection with the political sphere, explained to Vox over email in December. “The Kremlin has utilized these insecurities in its anti-gender queerphobic propaganda,” cracking down on LGBTQ groups and other perceived opponents while also militarizing society and “culminating in the escalating military aggression toward neighboring states (Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014).”', 'Putin also systematically undermined or eliminated political opposition, cementing his hold on power not just through a popular narrative about Russia’s national identity, but also with election fraud, murder, poisonings, draconian jail sentences, and other political repression.', 'Over the past year, the Kremlin quashed multiple attempts to compete against him in this weekend’s elections. Though three competitors did stand in this year’s contest, they were all state-backed and lacked any real popular support. There were multiple true opposition candidates with demonstrated popular support — like Boris Nadezhdin, an anti-war candidate — who attempted to stand against Putin this year but were barred from doing so.', 'Now, almost anyone who would vocally oppose or present an alternative to Russian propaganda has been silenced or has fled.', 'Will you help keep Vox free for all?', 'At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

This time, Boris Nadezhdin — whose campaign some initially suspected was sanctioned from on high — was barred by the authorities after his anti-war stance showed signs of drawing significant support.', '', '', '', 'The Putinist system may, like the late Soviet one, be more brittle than it appears; when the mutinous warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin briefly marched towards the Kremlin last June, some liberal critics saw it as the beginning of a collapse they had long forecast. Since Prigozhin’s not-so-mysterious death in a plane crash, Putin seems to have regained his grip, despite signs of official jumpiness around the election.', 'The west’s ability to influence developments inside Russia is limited. It must do more, though, to squeeze Moscow’s war machine by enforcing sanctions better, and to persuade developing countries of the need to implement them too. The biggest task is to rebuild western defences as a deterrent — and to give Ukraine all the support it needs. Ensuring Putin does not prevail there is the best way to deter him from going further.

"Russian Presidential Vote an ‘Imitation,’ Election Watchdog Golos Says",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1vc2Nvd3RpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzE4L3J1c3NpYW4tcHJlc2lkZW50aWFsLXZvdGUtYW4taW1pdGF0aW9uLWVsZWN0aW9uLXdhdGNoZG9nLWdvbG9zLXNheXMtYTg0NTEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['Independent election watchdog Golos has called Russia’s March 15-17 presidential election an “imitation,” with widespread reports of vote tampering, restrictions on monitors and pressure on voters, according to a report published by the organization on Monday.  ', 'Golos said Russian authorities sought to “imitate” all key aspects of a democratic electoral process during the three-day voting period, from the participation of multiple candidates in the race to the presence of international observers at polling places.', 'But “never before have we seen a presidential campaign that fell so short of constitutional standards,” the watchdog said, noting a gradual weakening of voters’ rights in Russia “almost every year” over the past two decades.', 'The Moscow Times has gathered the main takeaways from Golos’ report on the 2024 presidential election, which wrapped up on Sunday and saw President Vladimir Putin clinch a fifth overall term in office. ', 'Since Russia’s last presidential election in 2018, the authorities have adopted more than 11 amendments to the country’s election laws aimed at “limiting the voting rights of citizens” and “reducing opportunities for public oversight,” according to Golos. ', 'Among those changes, it singled out the 2020 constitutional amendments as the most harmful, as they allowed Putin to reset his term count and remain in power until 2036. ', 'At the same time, Golos said the introduction of multiday and online voting in recent years has made it much more difficult for independent monitoring of the voting process, all the while making electoral fraud easier. ', 'So, too, has Russia’s law on “foreign agents” — which has impacted hundreds of NGOs, news outlets, journalists, activists and cultural figures — marred elections by limiting their ability to take part in political life.', 'Voters were subjected to “unprecedented pressure” during this year’s presidential election as the Kremlin sought to achieve a record turnout. ', 'Golos said it received reports of citizens being coerced into voting from at least 60 regions across Russia, mostly among public sector workers, employees of state-linked corporations, as well as workers at some private businesses. ', 'Information obtained by the watchdog indicates that state-linked entities in Moscow were provided lists of employees who cast their ballots online. ', 'The 2024 presidential race was the first in Russia’s history to take place without the presence of OSCE election monitors. Instead, the Russian authorities invited handpicked “international election experts” whose credibility was suspect. ', 'In several Russian regions, candidates and the parties they represent refused to register their own independent observers, while in some areas authorities moved to recall observers’ registration after the start of the voting period, according to Golos.', 'Some independent electoral observers were removed from polling stations by force and subjected to searches and detentions, while those permitted to stay were barred from moving around polling locations, as well as from taking photos and recording videos of suspected irregularities.  ', 'Golos received reports of voting irregularities from 45 regions, according to Monday’s report. Among the irregularities identified by the watchdog were ballot stuffing, “carousel voting” and the improper storage of ballots overnight. ', 'Fraudulent votes amounted to at least 31.6 million — or nearly half of all ballots cast for Vladimir Putin — according to estimates by Novaya Gazeta Europe. ', 'Golos said the March 15-17 election was “characterized by unprecedented levels of violence and emotional tension.” ', 'Following multiple reports of dye-spilling incidents and arson attacks at polling places, Russian officials increased the presence of law enforcement at voting stations. ', 'In Moscow, as well as the Irkutsk region and the republic of Udmurtiya, voting booths were dismantled at some polling stations and police were reportedly spying on voters’ ballots, according to Golos. ', 'At least 22 people were arrested over attempts to spoil ballots with dye, while 12 others were detained for trying to set polling stations and individual ballot boxes on fire, according to Golos. ', '“Golos definitively condemns these practices, which obstruct the [voting] results... and violate the voting rights of citizens. No political or personal motives can justify such actions on the part of voters,” the watchdog said.', 'As you may have heard, The Moscow Times, an independent news source for over 30 years, has been unjustly branded as a ""foreign agent"" by the Russian government. This blatant attempt to silence our voice is a direct assault on the integrity of journalism and the values we hold dear.', 'We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. Our commitment to providing accurate and unbiased reporting on Russia remains unshaken. But we need your help to continue our critical mission.', ""Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2.

That follows years of repression and a crackdown on dissent that has accelerated since Moscow invaded Ukraine two years ago and the whole election process being controlled. In claiming victory, Putin again sought to threaten the West against deploying troops to Ukraine, saying that a possible conflict between Russia and Nato would put the world “a step away” from a third world war.', 'The announcement last month that Putin’s fiercest critic, Alexei Navalny, was dead – with the opposition leader having spent his last few weeks in a brutal Arctic prison on charges that the international community have decried as trumped up – was the starkest example of the state of Putin’s Russia ahead of the election. World leaders laid the blame for Nanalny’s death at Putin’s door, and his widow Yulia called Putin “a killer, a gangster”.', 'Other Navalny allies later accused Putin of being a “bloodsucking bug who will soon burst” after the Russian leader said his rival’s name for the first time in public for the first time in years as he claimed victory', '“Putin removes his political opponents, controls the media, and then crowns himself the winner,” said Britain’s foreign secretary, David Cameron. “This is not democracy.”', 'Golos, an independent Russian watchdog, described the vote as the most fraudulent in Russian history.

A senior Ukrainian official said on Monday that this was a clear indication Moscow planned to escalate its war. “This is ... a direct manifest statement that the war will only escalate,” presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters. The Kremlin leader did not provide details but said the buffer zone may have to be big enough to stop what he said were foreign-made weapons striking Russian territory.', 'Putin also hailed his Kremlin-controlled triumph at the polls as indicative of the “trust” and “hope” the country has in his leadership, a narrative the West has been eager to dispel. Putin spoke later on Monday at a large stadium event in Moscow to mark the 10th anniversary of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, which started the path towards the current invasion.

In reality, though, the praise came only from a few countries.', 'Russia and China have become increasingly close during Xi Jinping’s rule over China', 'Chinese president Xi Jinping, who declared a “limitless friendship” with Putin just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, said: “Your re-election is a full demonstration of the support of the Russian people for you.', '“China attaches great importance to the development of China-Russia relations and stands ready to maintain close communication with Russia to promote the sustained, healthy, stable and in-depth development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership.”', 'Similar words of support came from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi. Both countries are believed to be supplying weapons to Russia to be used against Ukraine. Some Central and South American leaders and presidents of nations with historic and close current ties to Russia also passed on their regards, such as Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.', 'Putin also received congratulations from both India and the UAE, nations with whom the Russian leader has sought good relations in recent years.

There could be no negotiations and nothing with Mr Putin.”', 'Other allies of Navalny reacted with fury after Putin decided to name the opposition leader in public for the first time in years. Putin described the death as a “sad event” – despite being accused of his killing – before claiming that he had agreed to a prisoner swap just days before Navalny’s death. That was likely to rub salt in the wounds of Navalny’s family and supporters.', '“Putin called Navalny by name for the first time, a month after he cynically killed him,” said Leonid Volkov, who was Navalny’s chief of staff during his presidential run in 2018. “The bloodsucking bug revels in its impunity.

About 99.4% of the votes had been counted. This marks a record win for Putin, who took home 77% of the vote in 2018.', ""There was never any doubt Putin would win at the ballot box. His opponents — who are far from Putin's level of clout and influence — were pre-approved by Russia's election commission and posed no serious challenges to the incumbent leader."", 'A main challenge for Putin was, in fact, just getting a high voter turnout.', 'The Russian state was actively involved in that undertaking, with civil servants and state-linked companies pressuring employees to cast their ballots. Some staffers were also expected to bring family members along and had to share their geolocations with their bosses via a special app, independent Russian media outlets reported.', 'David Szakonyi, a political-science professor at George Washington University, told Business Insider last week that voter turnout was an extremely important metric for Putin.', 'Szakonyi said the facade of a free and fair election was important to Putin because it would show Russians and the rest of the world that he had been democratically elected and had a ""natural and justified defensible place in Russian politics.""', 'Szakonyi said that with the presidential election behind him, Putin would be turning his attention back to the war in Ukraine because winning the war was still his top priority.', 'That means Russia is expected to keep producing and sourcing more military goods, in turn boosting the economy and further consolidating support for Putin.', ""Putin's victory has much to do with how his administration managed to steady Russia's economy and keep Russians on a relatively stable footing over the past two years amid the war."", 'Related stories', ""Merely winning has never been enough for Putin — and this year's presidential election is no different"", ""Putin is promising Russians billions of dollars of lifestyle improvements — but it's unclear where all that money will come from"", ""Russia's economy appears resilient, but companies are going bankrupt by the hundreds"", ""Russia's GDP grew 3.6% in 2023.

According to election officials, turnout exceeded 77 percent, and Putin took home roughly 87 percent of the vote — breaking all records in the history of modern Russia. Having topped the official results of the election Aleksandr Lukashenko stole in Belarus in 2020, Putin’s latest win is drawing comparisons with autocratic leaders in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, who typically claim more than 90 percent of the vote. For the inside scoop on what Kremlin officials think about the voting results, Meduza special correspondent Andrey Pertsev spoke to sources close to the Putin administration, a political strategist, and regional officials. Here’s what they said.', 'The Putin administration’s political bloc actually exceeded the targets set for the 2024 presidential vote. As Meduza reported previously, Kremlin officials tasked Russia’s regional governments with securing 70 percent voter turnout and 80 percent support for Putin. According to one election strategy document obtained by Meduza, the leadership of one Russian region set themselves this exact target and planned to achieve it primarily through mobilizing public sector employees and the employees of companies close to the state.', 'But in the weeks before the vote, the Putin administration began to express a “desire” for the incumbent to win upwards of 80 percent, two regional officials told Meduza on condition of anonymity. As a result, 80 percent support was perceived as an absolute minimum and many regions decided to aim for 85. As a Meduza source close to the administration put it, the head of the Kremlin’s political bloc, Sergey Kiriyenko, really “wanted to show the president very high numbers — and that’s what he did.” ', 'At the same time, a political strategist working with the Putin administration in one Russian region highlighted another contributing factor in the sky-high results for Putin: Russia’s far eastern regions “set the bar to wow,” prompting the rest of the country to follow suit. “The Far East tallies the results earlier and then the other regions want to show better numbers,” he explained. ', 'Indeed, most of the regions in Russia’s Far Eastern Federal District reported that Putin won more than 85 percent of the vote. The Khabarovsk Krai, which Kremlin officials consider a “protest region,” was the exception, reporting 80 percent support for Putin. ', 'A regional official also told Meduza that Putin’s envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District steered local administrations towards the target of 85 percent. The presidential envoy, Deputy Prime Minister Yury Trutnev, “wanted to demonstrate that the Far East is the president’s base and not an opposition territory,” the official said. ', 'Kremlin officials don’t see a problem with Putin achieving such high numbers. Two sources close to the Putin administration told Meduza that Kiriyenko is pleased with the election results and doesn’t consider them “overkill or falsified bullshit.” According to a source close to United Russia’s leadership, Kiriyenko has already made personal phone calls to most of Russia’s governors to thank them for their help in the elections. ', '“No matter what anyone says [about regional officials] ‘overdoing it’ or ‘going overboard,’ they won’t be punished for a victory. The Supreme Leader likes it; he perceives this as real support. [Kiriyenko] knows how to present it to him and sell it, that’s the main thing,” said a source close to the Kremlin. ', 'Another source close to the Putin administration drew special attention to the results reported in Moscow. According to election officials, Putin won more than 85 percent of the vote in the capital — a number just below the national average. “Before there was a gap — [it was] more than five percent in the last campaign. Now Moscow is an exemplary, loyal region. [Mayor Sergey] Sobyanin can sell this to the president as his [personal] achievement; he pacified the capital,” the source said. ', 'The runner-up in the election, Communist Party (KPRF) candidate Nikolai Kharitonov, netted 4.31 percent of the vote. New People Party candidate Vladislav Davankov and LDPR leader Leonid Slutsky scraped up 3.85 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. This means that all three of Putin’s “challengers” surpassed the required threshold for their parties to receive around 500 million rubles ($5.4 million) in federal funding. ', 'Your help can be the bridge to hope for many in Russia. Join Meduza in its mission to challenge censorship with the truth. Donate today.', 'Initially, the Putin administration hoped Slutsky would come in second, but after he failed on the campaign trail, the Kremlin didn’t bother to significantly rig the vote in his favor. On election day, Meduza’s sources close to the presidential administration said that Davankov was most likely to take second place, but they also said that Kharitonov still stood a chance. ', '“Davankov wouldn’t have been prevented [from coming in second]. In many regions he really did come in second place, but he fell short. And the KPRF’s electorate of true believers came out in support of Kharitonov. Plus, he was a more comfortable [candidate] for the administrations of the southern regions and national republics, where Davankov is an obscure [figure],” explained a source close to the Kremlin. ', 'Pro-Kremlin media, he added, still plans to spin Kharitonov’s results as a defeat for the KPRF, underscoring that the party achieved “a record low result and didn’t reach 10 percent.” ', 'As Meduza reported previously, Kremlin officials weren’t overly concerned with who would be the runner-up. “They didn’t interfere with Kharitonov either,” the source said. “Second place with four percent isn’t second place with 10 percent. All [the candidates were] equally weak — except the one in first place.” ', 'Story by Andrey Pertsev', 'Translation by Eilish Hart ', '', '', 'Underreported stories. Fresh perspectives.
