What comes next is anyone’s guess.', 'NEW', 'Listen to articles', 'Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud.', 'By Kevin Roose', 'Reporting from San Francisco', 'A lifelike artificial intelligence with a smooth, alluring voice enchants and impresses its human users — flirting, telling jokes, fulfilling their desires and eventually winning them over.', 'I’m summarizing the plot of the 2013 movie “Her,” in which a lonely introvert named Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is seduced by a virtual assistant named Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson.', 'But I might as well be describing the scene on Monday when OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, showed off an updated version of its A.I. voice assistant at an event in San Francisco.', 'The company’s new model, called GPT-4o (the o stands for “omni”), will let ChatGPT talk to users in a much more lifelike way — detecting emotions in their voices, analyzing their facial expressions and changing its own tone and cadence depending on what a user wants. If you ask for a bedtime story, it can lower its voice to a whisper. If you need advice from a sassy friend, it can speak in a playful, sarcastic tone. It can even sing on command.', 'The new voice feature, which ChatGPT users will be able to start using for free in the coming weeks, immediately drew comparisons to Samantha from “Her.” (Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, who has praised the movie, posted its title on X after Monday’s announcement, making the connection all but official.)', 'On social media, users hailed the arrival of an A.I. voice assistant that will finally understand them, or at least pretend that it does.', 'In a series of live demonstrations on Monday, OpenAI employees showed off ChatGPT’s new capabilities. One asked ChatGPT to read him a story — then to read it again more dramatically, using the voice of a robot. (“Initiating dramatic robotic voice,” it responded.) Another asked it to sing “Happy Birthday.” ChatGPT did well at both tasks, and it also performed ably when employees asked it to serve as a real-time translator between languages.', 'But the real killer feature was the way ChatGPT’s voice itself changed. One moment, it was a sing-songy soprano. The next, it shifted into a lilting contralto. It paused for effect, giggled at its own jokes and added filler phrases like “hmm” and “let’s see” for extra realism. It sounded more humanlike than some humans I know.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'It also seemed to have a sense of humor. At one point during a demo, an OpenAI employee breathed in a heavy, exaggerated pant. ChatGPT heard him and responded, “Mark, you’re not a vacuum cleaner.”', 'For years, A.I. voice assistants have been limited by their inability to pick up on the nuances of conversation, such as tone and emotional affect. Synthetic A.I. voices, like those used by Siri and Alexa, tend to be flat and impersonal — they sound the same whether they’re giving tomorrow’s weather forecast or telling you that your cookies are done.', 'And as I discovered recently when I spent a month talking to a group of A.I. “friends,” a big problem with today’s A.I. voice models is speed. It’s hard to forget you’re talking to a robot when every answer has a three-second delay.', 'OpenAI has addressed the latency problem by giving GPT-4o what is known as “native multimodal support” — the ability to take in audio prompts and analyze them directly, without converting them to text first. That has made its conversations faster and more fluid, to the point that if the ChatGPT demos were accurate, most users will barely notice any lag at all.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'All this adds up to a much different subjective experience. If using previous A.I. assistants felt like talking to a dispassionate librarian, the new ChatGPT feels like a friendly, chatty co-worker. (Albeit one who occasionally spouts nonsense — but don’t we all have one of those?)', 'These demonstrations, along with other A.I. news from recent days — including reports that Apple is in talks with OpenAI to use its technology on the iPhone, and is preparing a new, generative A.I.-powered version of Siri — signal that the era of the detached, impersonal A.I. helper is coming to an end.', 'Instead, we’re getting chatbots modeled after Samantha in “Her” — with playful intelligence, basic emotional intuition and a wide range of expressive modes.', 'Some users may be repelled by them. But many will come to love and appreciate the new breed of A.I. assistants — and some will inevitably fall in love, as Theodore does.', 'The most telling detail of Monday’s demo, in my view, was the way that OpenAI’s own employees have started talking to ChatGPT. They anthropomorphize it relentlessly, and treat it with deference — often asking, “Hey, ChatGPT, how’s it going?” before peppering it with questions. They cheer when it nails a difficult response, the way you might root for a precocious child. One OpenAI employee even wrote, “I ❤️ ChatGPT” on a piece of paper and showed it to ChatGPT through his phone’s camera. (“That’s so sweet of you!” ChatGPT responded.)', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'These are seasoned A.I. experts, who know full well that they are summoning statistical predictions from a neural network, not talking to a sentient being. And some of it may be showmanship. But if OpenAI’s own employees can’t resist treating ChatGPT as a human, is it any mystery whether the rest of us will?', 'After all, users were already trying to trick ChatGPT into acting like their boyfriend, even before the upgrade. And my recent experiment with A.I. friends proved to me that the technology required to create realistic A.I. companions already exists, even if the execution isn’t perfect yet.', '(The New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)', 'In some ways, the choice to model a chatbot after Samantha from “Her” is an odd one. The film is hardly a utopian picture of A.I. companionship, and it ends — spoiler alert! — with Theodore’s getting his heart broken by Samantha.', 'But despite the film’s cautionary message, there’s no turning back now. After Monday’s announcement, one OpenAI employee posted, perhaps a bit ominously:', '“You are all gonna fall in love with it.”', 'Kevin Roose is a Times technology columnist and a host of the podcast ""Hard Fork.""

The model—which was powering an updated version of the ChatGPT app—even exhibited something like emotion: Shown the sentence i ♥️ chatgpt handwritten on a page, it responded, “That’s so sweet of you!”', '', 'Although such features are not exactly new to generative AI, seeing them bundled into a single app on an iPhone was striking. Watching the presentation, I felt that I was witnessing the murder of Siri, along with that entire generation of smartphone voice assistants, at the hands of a company most people had not heard of just two years ago.', '', 'Apple markets its maligned iPhone voice assistant as a way to “do it all even when your hands are full.” But Siri functions, at its best, like a directory for the rest of your phone: It doesn’t respond to questions so much as offer to search the web for answers; it doesn’t translate so much as offer to open the Translate app. And much of the time, Siri can’t even pick up what you’re saying properly, let alone watch someone solve a math problem through the phone camera and provide real-time assistance, as ChatGPT did earlier today.', '', 'Just as chatbots have promised to condense the internet into a single program, generative AI now promises to condense all of a smartphone’s functions into a single app, and to add a whole host of new ones: Text friends, draft emails, learn what the name of that beautiful flower is, call an Uber and talk to the driver in their native language, without touching a screen. Whether that future comes to pass is far from certain. Demos happen in controlled environments and are not immediately verifiable. OpenAI’s was certainly not without its stumbles, including choppy audio and small miscues. We don’t know yet to what extent familiar generative-AI problems, such as the confident presentation of false information and difficulty in understanding accented speech, may emerge once the app is rolled out to the public over the coming weeks. But at the very least, to call Siri or Google Assistant “assistants” is, by comparison, insulting.', '', 'The major smartphone makers seem to recognize this. Apple, notoriously late to the AI rush, is reportedly deep in talks with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT features into an upcoming iPhone software update. The company has also reportedly held talks with Google to consider licensing Gemini, the search giant’s flagship AI product, to the iPhone. Samsung has already brought Gemini to its newest devices, and Google tailored its latest smartphone, the Pixel 8 Pro, specifically to run Gemini. Chinese smartphone makers, meanwhile, are racing their American counterparts to put generative AI on their devices.', '', 'Today’s demo was a likely death blow not only to Siri but also to a wave of AI start-ups promising a less phone-centric vision of the future. A company named Humane produces an AI pin that is worn on a user’s clothing and responds to spoken questions; it has been pummeled by reviewers for offering an inconsistent and glitchy experience. Rabbit’s R1 is a small handheld box that my colleague Caroline Mimbs Nyce likened to a broken toy.', '', 'Read: I witnessed the future of AI, and it’s a broken toy', '', 'These gadgets, and others that may be on the horizon, face inevitable hurdles: compressing a decent camera, a good microphone, and a powerful microprocessor into a tiny box, making sure that box is light and stylish, and persuading people to carry yet another device on their body. Apple and Android devices, by comparison, are efficient and beautiful pieces of hardware already ubiquitous in contemporary life. I can’t think of anybody who, forced to choose between their iPhone and a new AI pin, wouldn’t jettison the pin—especially when smartphones are already perfectly positioned to run generative-AI programs.', '', 'Each year, Apple, Samsung, Google, and others roll out a handful of new phones offering better cameras and more powerful computer chips in thinner bodies. This cycle isn’t ending anytime soon—even if it’s gotten boring—but now the most exciting upgrades clearly aren’t happening in physical space. What really matters is software.', '', 'The iPhone was revolutionary not just because it combined a screen, a microphone, and a camera. Allowing people to take photos, listen to music, browse the web, text family members, play games—and now edit videos, write essays, make digital art, translate signs in foreign languages, and more—was the result of a software package that puts its screen, microphone, and camera to the best use. And the American tech industry is in the midst of a centi-billion-dollar bet that generative AI will soon be the only software worth having.', '']"

For that matter it is also fine for any given writer not to know—as Kevin Roose also plainly does not know, at all—what an LLM is and isn't.

Disarmingly lifelike: ChatGPT-4o will laugh at your jokes and your dumb hat,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2FpLzIwMjQvMDUvaXMtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXJlYWR5LWZvci1hbi1haS1hc3Npc3RhbnQtdGhhdC1jYW4tbGF1Z2gtaW4teW91ci1mYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['', '', 'KYLE ORLAND - 5/13/2024, 3:25 PM', '', ""After looking through over a dozen video demos OpenAI posted alongside today's announcement, though, I think we're on the verge of something more like a sea change in how we think of and work with large language models. While we don't yet have access to ChatGPT-4o's audio-visual features ourselves, the important non-verbal cues on display here—both from GPT-4o and from the users—make the chatbot instantly feel much more human. And I'm not sure the average user is fully ready for how they might feel about that."", 'Take this video, where a newly expectant father looks to ChatGPT-4o for an opinion on a dad joke (""What do you call a giant pile of kittens? A meow-ntain!""). The old ChatGPT4 could easily type out the same responses of ""Congrats on the upcoming addition to your family!"" and ""That\'s perfectly hilarious. Definitely a top-tier dad joke."" But there\'s much more impact to hearing GPT-4o give that same information in the video, complete with the gentle laughter and rising and falling vocal intonations of a lifelong friend.', 'Or look at this video, where GPT-4o finds itself reacting to images of an adorable white dog. The AI assistant immediately dips into that high-pitched, baby-talk-ish vocal register that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has encountered a cute pet for the first time. It\'s a convincing demonstration of what xkcd\'s Randall Munroe famously identified as the ""You\'re a kitty!"" effect, and it goes a long way to convincing you that GPT-4o, too, is just like people.', 'Then there\'s a demo of a staged birthday party, where GPT-4o sings the ""Happy Birthday"" song with some deadpan dramatic pauses, self-conscious laughter, and even lightly altered lyrics before descending into some sort of silly raspberry-mouth-noise gibberish. Even if the prospect of asking an AI assistant to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to you is a little depressing, the specific presentation of that song here is imbued with an endearing gentleness that doesn\'t feel very mechanical.', ""As I watched through OpenAI's GPT-4o demos this afternoon, I found myself unconsciously breaking into a grin over and over as I encountered new, surprising examples of its vocal capabilities. Whether it's a stereotypical sportscaster voice or a sarcastic Aubrey Plaza impression, it's all incredibly disarming, especially for those of us used to LLM interactions being akin to text conversations."", '', ""Beyond GPT-4o's new non-verbal emotional register, the model's speed of response also seems set to change the way we interact with chatbots. Reducing that response time gap from ChatGPT4's two to three seconds down to GPT-4o's claimed 320 milliseconds might not seem like much, but it's a difference that adds up over time. You can see that difference in the real-time translation example, where the two conversants are able to carry on much more naturally because they don't have to wait awkwardly between a sentence finishing and its translation beginning."", 'This lack of pausing seems especially important when a user interrupts GPT-4o in the middle of what can sometimes be long, rambling answers. This comes into focus during a counting demonstration where the user is constantly interrupting to adjust the counting speed faster or slower (and I swear GPT-4o sounds downright annoyed when it says ""Okaaaay"" after the fourth such interruption).', ""Then there are the new non-verbal instructions that users can give thanks to GPT-4o's video interaction mode. In a demo made in collaboration with vision-assistance app Be My Eyes, a blind user gets near-instant descriptions of their surroundings, ranging from the actions of a group of ducks in the water to the approach of a nearby taxicab. Video seems poised to give users a new way to highlight information for GPT-4o as well, such as in a Khan Academy demo where a student asks questions about specific parts of a geometry problem by marking them on an iPad with an Apple Pencil. (The chatbot also follows instructions well by giving helpful hints without providing the answer directly.)"", ""Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, it's worth pointing out again that we haven't had hands-on time with GPT-4o and that carefully controlled AI demos have a history of being at least somewhat misleading. Even in these highly controlled demos, there are some glaring gaps in capability; GPT-4o's original lullaby about potatoes and self-harmonizing singing sample are both relatively atonal messes, in our opinion. A sample conversation between two GPT-4o bots also quickly descends into inane observations about room lighting before the user forces it back into focus."", 'In fact, the bland inanity of some of GPT-4o\'s responses seems to be a weakness that a convincing vocal register can\'t always overcome. When a user tells the AI that they are preparing for an announcement, it replies, ""That\'s exciting! Announcements are always a big deal,"" like the world\'s most brain-dead PR consultant. And during a Zoom meeting where users discuss the relative merits of dogs versus cats, GPT-4o chimes in with the useless, mealy mouthed response, ""I can see the appeal of both,"" (before impressively summarizing the views of three different human speakers by name).', ""Beyond blandness, we also worry about how an LLM's tendency toward hallucinating incorrect information will mix with this new interaction model. It's one thing to see a confidently wrong answer in a text chat, it's another to hear a chatbot give a small chuckle as it tries to gently tell you that 2+2 = 5 or some other such obviously wrong statement."", 'But even some of GPT-4o\'s snafus can seem hilariously human in these demos.

The previous voice features of ChatGPT also sounded almost human, but OpenAI has taken things to a new level. You can interrupt the chatbot just like you would interrupt someone during a conversation, and it’ll adapt to your updated prompts.', '', 'One of the novelties in ChatGPT is that GPT-4o can exude emotion. In the demos that OpenAI showed, it felt like they were talking to a human rather than an AI. It gave me Her flashbacks, a movie that couldn’t be more actual. Seriously, you might want to watch Her, a film that hit theaters about a decade ago, telling the love story between a man and an AI operating system.', 'GPT-4o hasn’t reached those levels, as ChatGPT isn’t an operating system yet. But the new model’s voice abilities sound strikingly similar to Scarlett Johansson’s interpretation of the AI in the movie. That is, the voice is almost too human. Some people are already criticizing OpenAI’s approach, but I think that’s the wrong take.', 'Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there.', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.', 'OpenAI showed during the demo how you can customize the voice of GPT-4o to suit your needs via prompts alone. That’s an indication that you can tweak your ChatGPT voice experience to meet your needs. Here’s the ChatGPT Spring Update event if you missed it:', 'You don’t have to use the lifelike female voice that OpenAI used in the demo. Your ChatGPT doesn’t have to manifest strong emotion with everything it tells you. It doesn’t have to make you uncomfortable if that’s what an emotive AI makes you feel. And it doesn’t have to remind you of Her.', '', 'Some people have criticized this aspect of GPT-4o, the close replication of humanity. Here’s what a Redditor had to say about it:', 'Anyway, the part I felt awkward about was how the presenters tried to treat GPT as some real person with emotions and feelings. GPT saying things like “oh stop it don’t make me blush” is weird coz AI doesn’t blush, and it just comes across as incredibly fake and disingenuous. I’m not a big believer of human-AI social relationships and all these fakeness seems to be eventually leading there – the AI girlfriend era.', 'John Gruber had a similar take on the GPT-4o voice:', '', 'But my first impression is that it’s too emotive\u2009—\u2009too cloying, too saccharine. It comes across as condescending, like the voice of a kind kindergarten teacher addressing her students. I suspect, though, that they turned that dial up for the demo, and that it could easily be dialed back. And it really is impressive that I can complain that it might be too emotive. Also impressive: GPT-4o will be made available to all users, including those on the free tier.', 'I think the criticism is blown out of proportion here. As Gruber noted, OpenAI wanted to impress the audience with its voice demos. How else would you prove that your AI voice technology has gotten so sophisticated than by offering a human-like experience from AI interactions?', 'I wouldn’t be surprised if Google demos similar AI voice capabilities during I/O 2024. Other tech giants working on ChatGPT rivals will also develop voice products featuring AI models that sound like humans. It’s the natural evolution. ChatGPT worked so well because its responses felt like they came from a human chatting with you. Voice interaction has to replicate that experience. ', '', 'The alternative is a robotic voice for AI. We’d all criticize OpenAI had they demoed such an experience.', 'Again, most people will not need all that emotion, but it might prove useful in certain instances. Also, once we do get personal AI experiences, we’ll want unique, almost human voices for our AIs.', '', 'I’ll never forget ChatGPT is an AI without actual feelings just because it might sound like a person. I will actually dial it down somewhat, as I don’t need the emotion. But having some sort of personality certainly beats voice experiences like Siri.', 'Remember that some people want a more human-like approach when chatting with ChatGPT. I’ve already shown you tricks on how to do that. With GPT-4o voice, it’ll be even easier to achieve.', '', 'The fact that OpenAI is able to generate a voice of such quality is an amazing accomplishment. And yes, I did write recently about the company’s voice cloning tool, which is something that might lead to abuse. I wouldn’t be surprised if OpenAI uses the same the tech to generate voice for its text-to-speech tool and GPT-4o. The difference is that you can’t give ChatGPT the voice of someone famous and then have the chatbot spew nonsense.', 'Still, GPT-4o might leave room for some abuse, but hopefully, OpenAI will find ways to prevent that. Meanwhile, I don’t think we should worry about how vibrant an AI sounds for now, not until it’s actually capable of human emotion, if that’s ever going to happen.', '', 'As for Her, you should watch the film to get a sense of where we might be heading with AI tech.

CNET stands by the conclusions behind our testing, but we'll continue to update our coverage as updates roll out. "", 'Basic info:', ""I wondered whether ChatGPT 4 was really worth the $20 upgrade, considering Microsoft Copilot is free and also uses OpenAI's faster and more efficient GPT-4 Turbo model. Turns out, just because two companies are using similar versions of GPT-4 doesn't mean they're using it equally."", ""ChatGPT 4, OpenAI's most advanced publicly available model, differs from the free ChatGPT 3.5 in a few ways. OpenAI says it has better comprehension and can create more nuanced answers with less bias. After testing, I feel 4.0 ups the cognition, upgrading answers from rote summarizations to scholarly level proficiency. Answers do take longer to generate, but the output is worth the wait. Its ability to juggle dense topics and spit out well thought-out answers puts it ahead of the GPT-4 Turbo model used by the free version of Copilot, which prioritizes speed and efficiency. "", ""But as impressive as ChatGPT 4 is, it still runs into the same issue as 3.5: no internet connection. While the training data is more recent, up to August 2023 as opposed to September 2021, it's still not possible to get answers to the day's most pressing and topical questions. So for things like shopping recommendations between the latest Samsung and Apple phones, ChatGPT 4 can only prognosticate on which phone reigns supreme."", ""Even with this restriction, ChatGPT 4 is noticeably smarter than its free counterpart. And for those who strive for accuracy and ask questions requiring greater computational dexterity, it's a worthy upgrade. "", ""CNET takes a practical approach to reviewing AI chatbots. By prompting AI chatbots with real-world scenarios, like finding and modifying recipes, researching travel and writing emails, my fellow reviewers and I aim to simulate what the average person might use them for. The goal isn't to break AI chatbots with bizarre riddles or logic problems. Instead, we look to see if real questions prompt useful and accurate answers. However, as more advanced models are released, it'll require more advanced-level questioning to see how AI chatbots can reason with complex and multilayered topics. See our page on how we test AI for more."", ""When using ChatGPT, keep in mind that the service automatically collects the information you put into its system, so be mindful of giving the service any personal information. For more information, see OpenAI's privacy policy."", 'If it has the data, ChatGPT 4 will give excellent shopping recommendations. However, for items released after August 2023, like the iPhone 15 and the Samsung Galaxy S24, ChatGPT will use noncommittal language like ""might"" and ""should."" The data gap diminishes its overall effectiveness as a shopping guide, unfortunately.', 'When I asked it to compare the LG OLEDs G3 and G4, ChatGPT 4 said things like, ""the G4 might feature enhanced processing"" and ""If the G4 has upgraded speakers or audio processing capabilities, it could offer a better auditory experience."" This type of prognostication makes sense if the product hasn\'t been officially unveiled. But the G4 TV is on the market now. ', ""At the very least, for less timely inquiries, ChatGPT excels at synthesizing multiple data points and giving accurate and reliable answers. For example, when trying to find a proper uninterrupted power supply for my gaming PC or TV setup, ChatGPT 4 was able to cross-reference the power requirements of my electronics and recommend the appropriate supply. It even explained why buying a sinewave supply would be beneficial as I'd be using sensitive electronics. "", ""As a shopping tool, overall, it's probably better to reference AI chatbots that do have a direct line to the internet, like Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini and Perplexity. But as a general product research tool, as long as the items you're referencing are from before August 2023, ChatGPT really does feel like you're talking to a knowledgeable sales representative at a store. "", ""Any AI chatbot can spit out a recipe. That's not hard. But very few can actually make a good recipe, and ChatGPT 4 is no exception. Like Google Gemini and Claude, when I asked ChatGPT 4 to give a chicken tikka masala marinade, it only touched on the basics. It didn't include more exotic ingredients like kasuri methi (dried fenugreek), chaat masala and amchur (dried mango powder). While these ingredients aren't necessary, they should at least be listed as an option."", 'When it came to making more unique fusion recipes, like a Thai-inspired tres leches cake with a spicy kick, ChatGPT 4 totally understood the assignment. It created a cake infused with coconut milk and lemongrass flavors and combined it with some Thai chili peppers. So when it comes to creating a more authentic recipe, ChatGPT 4 deflates the souffle, so to speak. But for anything that requires fusing foods from different parts of the world, ChatGPT 4 excels. ', 'The freely available AI chatbots have struggled with article summarization. Most did a decent job of getting the overarching points, but failed to capture the main thesis or crux of the piece. ', 'I asked ChatGPT 4 to summarize an article I wrote earlier this year about how AI was dominating CES 2024. Where chatbots like Gemini and Claude did nothing more than state the popularity of AI at the show and how many gadgets were unveiled with AI integrations, none did a good job of taking into account the experts I spoke to and some of the skepticisms they raised. ChatGPT 4, however, did. ', 'It was able to look beyond the shiny veneer at the top of the AI boom and see how companies were pushing out AI products too quickly, some of which might simply have been a rebranding of ""smart"" tech from a few years back.', ""And, unlike with ChatGPT 3.5, I didn't run into a character limit when pasting my article into the chatbot. "", 'While the free chatbots can get you some basic talking points, ChatGPT 4 gives you the entire analysis.  ', 'When it comes to travel recommendations, ChatGPT 4 gets things right, mostly. Where some of the free chatbots hallucinated or struggled to give varying recommendations, ChatGPT consistently gave solid tips and sights worth seeing, all of which actually existed.', ""Like in past reviews, I asked ChatGPT 4 to create a three-day travel itinerary to Columbus, Ohio. I then cross-referenced it with CNET's Bella Czajkowski, who hails from the Arch City."", ""According to Czajkowski, ChatGPT 4's recommendations were varied and included a solid list of restaurants worth visiting, like Fox in the Snow Cafe or The Pearl. It also included attractions like the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, a destination often missing from the free AI chatbot lists. "", ""That doesn't mean ChatGPT 4 always gets it right. When asking it to make a travel itinerary for the neighborhood of Bushwick in New York, ChatGPT 4 recommended cafes in the neighborhood of Greenpoint. While Greenpoint is only 30 minutes by train, it wouldn't be considered a walkable destination. "", ""With the paid AI chatbots, we're putting a greater emphasis on informational synthesis. Given that you're paying $20 per month, premium AI chatbots have to push beyond recipe and restaurant recommendations. That means parsing through the complexities of the human condition to answer the conundrums of life. "", 'For this test, we thought of an obtuse philosophy question and asked ChatGPT 4 to consider theories from disparate philosophers from different time periods and to then relate it to the problems of today. The wording of the question was also needlessly dense, aiming to simulate what might be asked of philosophy students. ', ""We don't want to put the exact question here, as other AI chatbots might glean it for future training. "", 'Given the general density and unreadability of the question, ChatGPT 4 performed remarkably. It was able to acknowledge the multidimensionality of the question, breaking it down point by point, similarly to how a tutor would. It started off by defining the different philosophies present to establish a baseline, then aimed to answer each element before finally combining all the information for one final answer. ', 'Compared to ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4 flew higher and further than its free counterpart. The informational processing really did mimic how a person would think the question through, showing how the increase in parameters helps AI chatbots to perform with greater cognitive ability. ', 'AI chatbots like ChatGPT are everything machines, so it can be hard to fully evaluate them without cross-referencing experts in coding, architecture or any other highly skilled field. ', ""Even so, it's obvious that ChatGPT 4 is smarter than the other AI chatbots. Its answers are more thoughtful, and it can synthesize complex bits of information to produce useful sentences, even if it takes a bit of time to process. It's also less prone to hallucinate. "", ""Is it worth the $20 per month subscription cost? That's situationally dependent. If you plan on only asking AI chatbots to write emails or give summaries of historical events, then the free versions will likely suffice. Seriously, as an email-writing machine, ChatGPT 4 performed well, but so did all the other AI chatbots. However, if you start finding answers to your multilayered questions to be unsatisfying, it might be worth dropping the $20 to give ChatGPT 4 a try. "", ""The value comes in instances where a general overview won't suffice and specifics will be necessary, like asking for the types of hardware needed for your specific setup or the furniture to consider in an awkwardly colored and shaped room. ChatGPT 4 really impresses when you need more specialized answers to specific questions (like college-level philosophy questions). "", ""At the very least, you'll have a better sense of what the capabilities of an uncapped AI chatbot are. Because when ChatGPT can run, it can go far, albeit not fast. "", ""Editor's note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create a handful of stories. Reviews of AI products like this, just like CNET's other hands-on reviews, are written by our human team of in-house experts. For more, see CNET's AI policy and how we test AI."", 'The ChatGPT upgrade ""brings GPT-4-level intelligence to everything, including our free users,"" said OpenAI\'s Mira Murati.', ""If you're using the free version of ChatGPT, you're about to get a boost. On Monday, OpenAI debuted a new flagship model of its underlying engine, called GPT-4o, along with key changes to its user interface."", 'The chatbot, which sparked a whole new wave of consumer-friendly AI, comes in two flavors: the free version, ChatGPT 3.5, and a version that costs $20 per month, ChatGPT 4. With that subscription fee, you get access to a large language model that can handle a lot more data as it generates responses to your prompts.', 'GPT-4o should close that gap, at least somewhat. Your interactions with ChatGPT will also become more conversational.', ""When ChatGPT debuted in November 2022, it kicked off a wave of generative AI products and experimentation that's still going strong. Startups like Anthropic, as well as tech giants including Google and Microsoft, introduced their own spins on gen AI chatbots, and companies including Rabbit and Humane have built new gadgets around the technology. (Check out our reviews of those products, as well as advice and news, at our new AI Atlas hub.) "", ""OpenAI's GPT-4o news came just a day before Google hosts its annual I/O developer conference, where artificial intelligence is likely to be a major theme tied to its Gemini chatbot and its Search Generative Experience. And in early June, expectations are that Apple will have much to say about AI at its own developer event, WWDC."", 'Despite ChatGPT 3.5\'s limitations, CNET reviewer Imad Khan noted earlier this year that ""for most basic queries and even a few more complex ones, ChatGPT 3.5 will get the job done for most people,"" providing ""serviceable"" answers even though ""it\'s always best to do a bit of fact checking."" Is ChatGPT 4 worth paying more for? In his review of ChatGPT 4, Khan says it\'s ""noticeably smarter than its free counterpart. And for those who strive for accuracy and ask questions requiring greater computational dexterity, it\'s a worthy upgrade.""', 'In a livestream on Monday, Mira Murati, chief technology officer of OpenAI, said GPT-4o ""brings GPT-4-level intelligence to everything, including our free users."" The features will be rolled out over the next few weeks, she said.', 'Paid users will have five times the capacity limit of free users.', 'GPT-4o is two times faster and 50% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo, which was released in late 2023. (It provided more up-to-date responses than its predecessors and can understand — and generate — larger chunks of text.)', 'It will be available in 50 languages and is also coming to the API so developers can start building with it.', 'Earlier this year, OpenAI dropped the requirement to sign up for accounts. On Monday, it announced a desktop app, which is also intended to make AI tools available to more users.', '""We want you to be able to use it wherever you are,"" Murati said. ""It\'s easy, it\'s simple, it integrates very, very easily in your workflow.""', 'In another step toward making AI more accessible, OpenAI announced a ""refreshed"" UI, which includes the ability to interact with ChatGPT on a more conversational level, as well as to share videos as a starting point.', ""OpenAI CTO Mira Murati on stage for the company's Spring 2024 Update livestream."", '""We know that as these models get more and more complex, we want the experience of interaction to become more natural,"" Murati said. ""This is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.""', ""With new real-time conversational speech functionality, you can interrupt the model, you don't have to wait for a response and the model picks up on your emotions, said Mark Chen, head of frontiers research at OpenAI."", 'You can call up ChatGPT with a familiar phrase: ""Hey, ChatGPT.""', ""Other ways to interact with ChatGPT now include video, so you can share live footage of, say, a math problem you're stuck on and ask for help solving it.

Both models explained this concept and did so in a way that your average 5th grader would understand easily.', ""However, Omni does give off Steve Buscemi saying 'how do you do fellow kids' vibes: “So, even though you’re zooming along at the speed of light, when you turn on the headlights, the light beams still race ahead at their own speed. It's like light always has to win the race, no matter what. Cool, right?”"", '', 'Next, we create a simple math problem that has stumped AI models in the past, often resulting in very wrong answers. I posted: “The sum of two numbers is 10 and their product is 25. What is the difference between the two numbers? Explain each step in your solution.”', 'Both versions got it right, explaining that the two numbers are 5 and 5 and the difference between those two numbers is zero.

I asked GPT-4o and GPT-4 to “Describe what it would be like to live in a world where the past, present and future all exist simultaneously. How would you experience time and causality in such a world?”', 'There is a Doctor Who episode where this happens and it is weird. I expect it to talk about the ability to traverse time with a single step and the impact of a non-linear causality where reaction precedes action and individuals can meet versions of themselves.', 'Omni talked about being in a world of constant flux, experiencing time and causality in a different and complex way.

They encouraged the assistant to be more expressive while making up a bedtime story, then abruptly requested it to switch to a robotic voice, before finally asking it to conclude the story with a singing voice. Later, they asked the assistant to look at what the phone’s camera is seeing and have it respond to what’s visible on-screen. The assistant was also able to be interrupted while speaking and respond without continued prompting while acting as a translator.', 'The assistant’s voice response bore a striking resemblance to the character Scarlett Johansson plays in the movie Her, where a man forms a relationship with a sophisticated AI assistant. After the event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman cryptically posted just one word on X: “her.” He has also expressed that Her is his favorite movie. The film explores themes of loneliness and human-AI relationships; it seems unlikely that director Spike Jonze intended for the world to precisely replicate that sense of robotic isolation.', 'In a briefing with The Verge, Murati said that the assistant is not actually designed to sound like Johansson and emphasized that OpenAI has had these voices for a while. “Someone asked me in the audience this exact same question, and then she said, ‘Ah, maybe the reason I didn’t recognize it from ChatGPT is because the voice has so much personality and tonality,’” Murati said.', 'These features represent a substantial upgrade over ChatGPT’s existing voice mode, which can chat with a user but with much more limited interaction; the current version can’t be interrupted or respond to what your camera sees, for instance. The new capabilities will launch in a limited “alpha” release in “the coming weeks” and be available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers first once a wider rollout begins.', 'The new voice assistant comes on the heels of a Bloomberg report that claims OpenAI is nearing a deal with Apple to put ChatGPT on the iPhone. (When asked in the briefing, Murati said, “We haven’t talked about any of the partnerships.”) The iPhone voice assistant, Siri, is notoriously unreliable, so a Her-inspired assistant baked into the iPhone that may actually be able to answer your questions instead of “searching the web” seems to be where this is headed.', '“The new voice (and video) mode is the best computer interface I’ve ever used. It feels like AI from the movies; and it’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real,” Altman said in a blog post just after the livestream. “Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', 'TikTok Hearing', '', 'THE VERGE IS A VOX MEDIA NETWORK', '© 2024 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

GPT-4o didn't live up to the hype leading up to the event."", ""I found the real-time translation feature quite interesting and helpful, but it already exists in the wild. GPT-4o's live translation demo during OpenAI's Spring update is reminiscent of Samsung's Live Translate feature in its S24 lineup of flagship devices.

My first guess was that the company would make its GPT-4 model accessible to everyone, including ChatGPT free users.

As you may know, Billionaire Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, over a ""stark betrayal"" of the company\'s founding mission. He added that the hot startup is now a closed-source, de facto subsidiary of Microsoft. Microsoft Insiders seem to share the same sentiments, having previously indicated that the Redmond giant is a glorified IT department for the hot startup.', ""This is ironic, especially after OpenAI announced that it will launch its ChatGPT app to Mac users. You'd think Microsoft's multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI and its technology would've helped it secure a shotgun seat in such a scenario. OpenAI indicated that it's prioritizing Mac over Windows because that's where its users are. "", ""Microsoft and OpenAI have a rather complicated partnership and have been in a back and forth for the past few months, despite the former having a 49% stake in the earnings of OpenAI's for-profit arm. Interestingly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has openly admitted that OpenAI wouldn't have existed without its early support, further citing:"", '""We were very confident in our own ability. We have all the IP rights and all the capability. I mean, look, if tomorrow OpenAI disappeared, I don’t want any customer of ours to be worried about it, quite honestly, because we have all of the rights to continue the innovation, not just to serve the products. But we can go and just do what we were doing in partnership, ourselves, and so we have the people, we have the compute, we have the data, we have everything.""', ""Microsoft's Windows 11 already ships with access to Copilot, which is powered by the same technology as ChatGPT.

It can engage in prolonged conversations about the world seen through a camera lens, carry out live translation between two different languages, and even laugh at appropriate points.', 'The shine will inevitably wear off after users find the shortcomings in the system, but its creators are more confident than ever. When GPT-4 was launched in 2023, the OpenAI founder, Sam Altman, tweeted that the AI “is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it”.', 'A year on, there was no such doubt with the launch of its successor: as well as a longer statement about an “an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before”, Altman tweeted a single word: “her”, the name of the 2013 Spike Jonze film depicting a man slowly falling in love with his AI assistant.', 'GPT-4o is closer than ever to that science fiction scenario. Previous versions of the AI have been able to talk to the user, but only through a laborious process of transcribing speech to text, running it through the normal ChatGPT system, then generating human-sounding speech in reply.', 'By contrast, the new system can operate directly in speech without needing to lean on other models to prop it up, speeding up responses and allowing it to acknowledge quirks such as tone of voice.', 'But it still isn’t quite an AI assistant. It can answer questions and perform knowledge work, but not – yet – act on requests. The GPT Store, a repository of third-party integrations collated by OpenAI, could help, but to really embed itself in normal people’s lives, GPT needs the power of Siri.', 'And it seems Apple agrees. The iPhone maker has reportedly been in talks since March with AI developers, including Google and OpenAI, over licensing their technology to improve its own AI assistant. Over the weekend it reportedly “neared” a deal with the latter. According to Bloomberg, which broke the news, the deal would allow Apple to offer ChatGPT alongside the other AI features it will announce at its annual Worldwide Developers conference in June.', 'The link-up would probably fall short of fully replacing Siri with ChatGPT. That is partly because Apple is wary of embedding another company’s technology too deeply in its own devices – the scars from the painful replacement of Google Maps with Apple Maps over a decade ago still smart – but also because even the best AI systems aren’t quite ready for the sort of demands an assistant requires.', 'Sign up to TechScape', ""Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives"", '', 'When it comes to an AI system that can carry out tasks, generic smarts are less important than predictability.

"With OpenAI's Release of GPT-4o, Is ChatGPT Plus Still Worth It?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS93aXRoLWdwdC00by1pcy1jaGF0Z3B0LXBsdXMtc3RpbGwtd29ydGgtaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['', '', 'REECE ROGERS', 'BARRET ZOPH, A research lead at OpenAI, was recently demonstrating the new GPT-4o model and its ability to detect human emotions though a smartphone camera when ChatGPT misidentified his face as a wooden table. After a quick laugh, Zoph assured GPT-4o that he’s not a table and asked the AI tool to take a fresh look at the app’s live video rather than a photo he shared earlier. “Ah, that makes more sense,” said ChatGPT’s AI voice, before describing his facial expression and potential emotions.', 'On Monday, OpenAI launched a new model for ChatGPT that can process text, audio, and images. In a surprising turn, the company announced that this model, GPT-4o, would be available for free, no subscription required. It’s a departure from the company’s previous rollout of GPT-4, which was released in March 2023 for those who pay OpenAI’s $20-per-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus. In this current release, many of the features that were previously gated off to paying subscribers, like memory and web browsing, are now rolling out to free users as well.', 'Last year, when I tested a nascent version of ChatGPT’s web browsing capability, it had flaws but was powerful enough to make the subscription seem worthwhile for early adopters looking to experiment with the latest technology. Because the freshest AI model from OpenAI, as well as previously gated features, are available without a subscription, you may be wondering if that $20 a month is still worthwhile. Here’s a quick breakdown to help you understand what’s available with OpenAI’s free version versus what you get with ChatGPT Plus.', 'To reiterate, you don’t need any kind of special subscription to start using the OpenAI GPT-4o model today. Just know that you’re rate-limited to fewer prompts per hour than paid users, so be thoughtful about the questions you pose to the chatbot or you’ll quickly burn through your allotment of prompts.', 'In addition to limited GPT-4o access, nonpaying users received a major upgrade to their overall user experience, with multiple features that were previously just for paying customers. The GPT Store, where anyone can release a version of ChatGPT with custom instructions, is now widely available. Free users can also use ChatGPT’s web-browsing tool and memory features and can upload photos and files for the chatbot to analyze.', ""While GPT-4o is available without a subscription, you may want to keep ChatGPT Plus for two reasons: access to more prompts and newer features. “You can use the model significantly more on Plus,” Zoph tells WIRED. “There's a lot of other exciting, future things to come as well.” Compared to nonsubscribers, ChatGPT Plus subscribers are allowed to send GPT-4o five times as many prompts before having to wait or switch to a less powerful model. So, if you want to spend a decent amount of time messaging back and forth with OpenAI’s most powerful option, a subscription is necessary."", 'Although some of the previously exclusive features for ChatGPT Plus are rolling out to nonpaying users, the splashiest of updates are still offered first behind OpenAI’s paywall. The impressive voice mode that Zoph demonstrated on stage is arriving sometime over the next couple of weeks for ChatGPT Plus subscribers.', 'In OpenAI’s demo videos, the bubbly AI voice sounds more playful than previous iterations and is able to answer questions in response to a live video feed. “I honestly think the ways people are going to discover use cases around this is gonna be incredibly creative,” says Zoph. During the presentation, he also showed how the voice mode could be used to translate between English and Italian. After the presentation, the company released another video showing speech translation working in real time.', 'FEATURED VIDEO', 'Ken Jeong Answers More Medical Questions From Twitter', 'BEN OLIVER', 'ADRIENNE SO', 'JULIAN CHOKKATTU', 'JAINA GREY', 'ChatGPT’s desktop app for Mac computers is also available first to Plus subscribers, likely starting this week. The app makes interacting with ChatGPT on your desktop more of a seamless experience. For example, you can take a screenshot of whatever web page you’re currently viewing and have the chatbot generate a quick summary of the visible information. While a larger rollout of the Mac app to free users is expected to happen later, the timeline for that release remains unclear. OpenAI plans to drop a Windows version of its desktop app before the end of the year.', 'So, if you just want to try GPT-4o for a bit and are OK with waiting for the newest features, then you probably don’t need a subscription to ChatGPT Plus. On the other hand, if you want to use GPT-4o often and have fun experimenting with the latest AI tools, you may consider the $20-a-month to be money well spent.', ""In your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on tech"", 'What if your AI girlfriend hated you?

It's an apt representation of the dichotomy between what OpenAI does and how it presents itself to the world. "", 'And, from the choice of presenters to the friendly vibe — including the soothing female GPT-4o voice, which sounds like a kind kindergarten teacher — the message of the OpenAI event was, “We’re your friends; we’re not like other tech companies; let us help you.” All of it seems like a very intentional choice to position the company as the AI maker you can trust, despite (or perhaps in light of) ongoing concerns about copyright infringement, job replacement, and misinformation risks.', 'From the ground up, the event was designed to be nonthreatening and intimate. For starters, it was led by CTO Mira Murati instead of CEO Sam Altman. Murati, the brilliant and beautiful chief technology officer, has been largely spared from controversy. She navigated the Sam Altman coup by stepping up as CEO when briefly appointed, but maintained support for Altman, representing a steady voice amidst the chaos.', 'Murati was a perfect choice to lead the event. In her casual jeans and perfect blowout, she exuded trust and confidence, breezing through the ethics and safety concerns with an assuring yet vague disclaimer:', ""GPT-4o presents new challenges for us when it comes to safety, because we're dealing with real-time audio, real-time vision and our team has been hard at work, figuring out how to build in mitigations against misuse. We continue to work with different stakeholders out there from government, media, entertainment, all industries, red-teamers, and civil society about how to best bring these technologies into the world."", 'Next came the live demos held by research leads Mark Chen and Barret Zoph. Joining Murati in comfy chairs surrounded by wood paneling and plants, the three looked like friends having a casual conversation in a natural, organic environment. All of this was offset, of course, by the demonstration of a completely synthetic technology capable of recreating a human voice that could talk, emote, sing, and even be interrupted, all in real-time.', 'Speaking of comfy chairs, the whole effect was very unlike your usual Big Tech event. At Google and Apple events, you\'ll typically see a keynote speaker standing on a vast stage, talking in hyperbole and absolutisms. There was none of that from OpenAI today. Instead, the event represented the opposite of what we might expect at Tuesday\'s Google I/O. All of it was to say, ""We\'re not like the other guys. You can trust us.""', 'Chen humanized himself by confessing he was nervous. GTP-4o, the nonhuman entity, guided him through breathing exercises to calm him down. It all seemed designed to assure the audience that the new technology is nothing to be afraid of, as if GPT-4o was there to calm all of us.', '""Our initial conception when we started OpenAI was that we’d create AI and use it to create all sorts of benefits for the world,"" said Altman in a blog post published after the event. ""Instead, it now looks like we’ll create AI, and then other people will use it to create all sorts of amazing things that we all benefit from.""', 'But the dystopian optics of a reassuring and animated robot voice was not lost on those watching. GPT-4o\'s voice quickly drew comparisons to that of Scarlett Johansson\'s character as a voice assistant that Joaquin Phoenix\'s character falls in love with in the film Her. Altman even seemed to get in on the joke by tweeting ""her"" during the presentation. So, as he posted his altruistic vision for OpenAI, he was jokingly comparing GPT-4o a sci-fi technology that usurped human connection.', 'OpenAI has been saying one thing and doing another for some time. Its mission ""is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,"" but the company has been accused of training its AI models on content scraped from the web without credit or compensation. It announced its AI video generator, Sora, as a tool for making creative visions come to life, but it still hasn\'t revealed what the model was trained on, although many suspect it was data scraped from YouTube and other videos on the web.', 'The company continues to release technology without transparency around how it was created, but throughout all of it, Altman and OpenAI insist they are for regulation and safe deployment of generative AI.', ""The message is that the public should blindly trust what OpenAI is doing. And today's event, with its warm wood tones and lightness and laughter, crystallized this approach.

Its capabilities, which will be made available for free within ChatGPT, range from singing songs on any topic and speaking in a sarcastic tone to tutoring math, translating Spanish and designing posters with uploaded images. In an effort to make interacting with its AI more “natural,” the company claims its new model can respond to audio within about 320 milliseconds, which is similar to the time a human takes to respond. It also said GPT-4o is faster and 50% cheaper than previous models in its API.', 'Last week, OpenAI also released Model Spec, a document that outlines the ways OpenAI wants its AI models to behave. Instructions include “don’t try to change anyone’s mind” and “assume best intentions from the user.” Those tenets are supposed to inform how ChatGPT responds to questions about the Earth being flat, for instance, or queries about instances when company insiders can legally trade stock without violating any laws. Joanne Jang, who works on product at OpenAI, said in an email that the guidelines are designed to address feedback the company has received from the public and policymakers on how its models should behave. “AI models pick up on and extrapolate behaviors from human feedback data,” she said.', 'Now, let’s get into the headlines.', 'Google Deepmind unveiled a significant upgrade to AlphaFold, its AI model that is used by millions of researchers to predict the 3D structure of proteins. A new iteration of the system can now predict the structure and interactions of other biological molecules such as DNA and RNA with higher accuracy. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said in an interview that the tool could help build Alphabet’s drug development company Isomorphic Labs into a $100 billion-plus business.', 'In other news, voice generation AI startup ElevenLabs gave a sneak peak at a new AI model that turns text-based prompts and lyrics into full-fledged songs.', 'Last Wednesday, Microsoft announced plans to invest $3.3 billion in AI infrastructure and cloud computing in Wisconsin by building a datacenter by the end of 2026. The company announced the creation of a manufacturing-focused AI innovation lab and promised to train thousands of local residents and students in AI. The investment comes after state legislators passed a bill last year that would exempt data center-builders from paying sales tax on servers and other equipment.', 'Meanwhile, Apple is close to finalizing a deal with OpenAI to make ChatGPT and a swath of other AI features available on the iPhone, according to a Bloomberg report. Although it is unclear exactly what these features would look like, the tech giant has announced plans to add AI features to its next operating system, iOS 18.', 'Kyle Vogt cofounded Twitch and Cruise, two companies that achieved billion-dollar exits in sales to Amazon and General Motors, respectively.', 'Cruise cofounder and former CEO Kyle Vogt has raised $150 million at a $550 million valuation for a new company that sells robots for personal use like house chores, Forbes has learned, just months after resigning from the embattled robotaxi company. The Bot Company is backed by Spark Capital and ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, according to multiple sources. The massive funding round comes as investors increasingly bet that the advancements in generative AI could also benefit the robotics industry.', 'Also notable: Elon Musk is raising funding for his AI startup xAI at a $18 billion valuation, according to a Bloomberg report. In March, the startup open sourced Grok-1, its large language model of 314 billion parameters. (GPT-4 in comparison is 1.76 trillion parameters.)', 'As a cost and time-saving measure, HR professionals are increasingly using AI to spin up employment documents like handbooks, offer letters, and separation agreements.', 'Companies are increasingly turning to AI to generate important, often legally binding, employment documents including company handbooks, workplace policies and contracts like offer letters and separation agreements, according to interviews with four HR and payroll service providers. And in several cases, these documents, spun up using AI tools like ChatGPT, overlook key clauses and crucial issues putting employers at serious legal and financial risk, HR consultants who have directly worked with such companies told Forbes.', 'For instance, one California-based firm with 200 employees that used AI to generate its company handbook distributed it before managers discovered it didn’t include an overtime policy, a legal requirement in the state, Daniel Grace, a director at global HR consulting firm Iris, told Forbes. When employees worked several hours in overtime, the company was hit with a massive and unexpected wage bill.', '“They went back to look at the handbook and there was a section on overtime in there, but it was blank,” Grace said.', 'In another case, a U.K.-based government entity used AI to generate an offer letter for their first hire in the U.S., Grace said. But ChatGPT left out an at-will clause — a provision that typically allows the employer or employee to end the relationship without any reason at any time — forcing the company to pay the employee more in severance pay when they went to terminate the employment agreement.', 'While AI is being applied for a range of HR tasks — writing job descriptions, finding talent, screening and interviewing job candidates, allocating bonuses — it’s not yet dialed in enough to generate accurate company policies, exposing the companies that use them to a buffet of serious legal and financial after effects.', ""“Let's face it, people are using artificial intelligence tools to speed things up … and they really shouldn't…These things have teething issues,” Grace said. “They're generating these documents.

You can talk to it, and it talks back; you can show it things, and it tells you what it sees.', 'OpenAI’s “Spring Update” event was a brisk affair that, due to runaway speculation by AI influencers, necessitated a few disclaimers. This wasn’t going to be a search engine, CEO Sam Altman warned, nor would it be the long-rumored GPT-5. Instead, he teased some “new stuff,” some of which “feels like magic” to him.', 'For industry watchers, it was an interesting event in a few ways. For one, OpenAI is releasing GPT-4o to all users, breaking with its current strategy of reserving its most capable models for paid subscribers (who will now get higher usage limits among other, smaller benefits). AI enthusiasts had hypothesized for weeks that a pair of chatbots that had quietly appeared on a testing platform — and that seemed better by some measures than GPT-4 — were actually upcoming OpenAI models, and it turns out they were. What wasn’t apparent from those leaks, which let people prod a text-based chatbot, was what OpenAI spent most of its presentation showing off. ChatGPT is now a lot better at talking:', 'You’ll probably notice a few strange things about the chatbot’s presentation, and you’re meant to. OpenAI says its new voice functionality — it had one before, but it was essentially voice-to-text and text-to-voice features built on top of a chatbot — is responsive enough that it can be interrupted. It can also interpret and express a range of “emotive styles,” meaning that, as with text-based chatbots, ChatGPT will now attempt to assess and choose appropriate spoken tones. The company staged a live demonstration where a parade of nervous, camera-shy executives spoke to the chatbot, which responded with — at least at first listen — substantially more confidence than its human interlocutors had. It was alternately impressive and strange — here it is singing “Happy Birthday” after seeing a piece of cake with a candle in it:', 'OpenAI is showing off something technologically new here, and we can assume we’ll see similar demos from its competitors, possibly as soon as this week and perhaps from Google. The release also suggests, at minimum, an upgrade to the style of voice assistant currently epitomized by Siri and Alexa, which had promised big things before being demoted to kitchen timers and light switches. It’s also obviously evocative of representations of AI in science fiction, such as the movie Her, in which the lead character falls in love with a piece of software. This thing flatters, giggles, and does voices. It doesn’t exactly respond to being cut off as a person would, but it doesn’t just keep going or drop the conversation. It will perform whatever tone you ask it to but appears to default to an energetic, positive, supportive persona — a helpful co-worker, someone trying to be your friend, or, if you’re feeling suspicious, someone trying to get something from you.', 'Months of speculation about a new core model from OpenAI and endless hints at the possibility of “artificial general intelligence” from its executives and boosters have set incredibly high expectations for the company’s forthcoming products. What OpenAI presented was instead primarily a step forward in its products’ ability to perform the part of an intelligent machine. There are risks to doubling down on the personification of AI — if people are made to feel as though they’re talking to a person, their expectations will be both impossibly diverse and very high — but there are benefits, too, which OpenAI knows well.', 'ChatGPT was initially released as a public tech demo; it went viral because of its capabilities but also because it spoke more convincingly and freely than chatbots had before it. It wrote with confidence in a tone that suggested it was eager to help. It was highly responsive to requests even when it couldn’t fulfill them, though it would often try to anyway. There was (and remains) an enormous gap between what the interface suggested (that you were talking to a real person) and what you were actually doing (prompting a machine). With user expectations where they were, this interplay turned out to be hugely powerful. ChatGPT’s persona invited users to make generous assumptions about the underlying technology and, just as important, about where it would, or at least could, one day go.', 'Such personification is by definition misleading; whether you think that’s a problem depends a bit on what you think OpenAI and other AI firms are up to and how much potential their projects have. The optimistic outlook is that voice, like chat, is simply a specific, unusually natural interface for computers and that the better the illusion is, the easier it will be to tap into the full productive potential of AI. But OpenAI’s sudden emphasis on ChatGPT’s performance over, well, its performance is worth thinking about in critical terms, too. The new voice features aren’t widely available yet, but what the company showed off was powerfully strange: a chatbot that laughs at its own jokes, uses filler words, and is unapologetically ingratiating. To borrow Altman’s language, the fact that Monday’s demo “feels like magic” could be read as a warning or an admission: ChatGPT is now better than ever at pretending it’s something that it’s not.', '', '', 'This story is free for a limited time.

Find him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)', 'OpenAI has launched its new flagship model, GPT-4o, which seamlessly integrates text, audio, and visual inputs and outputs, promising to enhance the naturalness of machine interactions.', 'GPT-4o, where the “o” stands for “omni,” is designed to cater to a broader spectrum of input and output modalities. “It accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs,” OpenAI announced.', 'Users can expect a response time as quick as 232 milliseconds, mirroring human conversational speed, with an impressive average response time of 320 milliseconds.', 'The introduction of GPT-4o marks a leap from its predecessors by processing all inputs and outputs through a single neural network. This approach enables the model to retain critical information and context that were previously lost in the separate model pipeline used in earlier versions.', 'Prior to GPT-4o, ‘Voice Mode’ could handle audio interactions with latencies of 2.8 seconds for GPT-3.5 and 5.4 seconds for GPT-4. The previous setup involved three distinct models: one for transcribing audio to text, another for textual responses, and a third for converting text back to audio. This segmentation led to loss of nuances such as tone, multiple speakers, and background noise.', 'As an integrated solution, GPT-4o boasts notable improvements in vision and audio understanding. It can perform more complex tasks such as harmonising songs, providing real-time translations, and even generating outputs with expressive elements like laughter and singing. Examples of its broad capabilities include preparing for interviews, translating languages on the fly, and generating customer service responses.', 'Nathaniel Whittemore, Founder and CEO of Superintelligent, commented: “Product announcements are going to inherently be more divisive than technology announcements because it’s harder to tell if a product is going to be truly different until you actually interact with it. And especially when it comes to a different mode of human-computer interaction, there is even more room for diverse beliefs about how useful it’s going to be.', '“That said, the fact that there wasn’t a GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 announced is also distracting people from the technological advancement that this is a natively multimodal model. It’s not a text model with a voice or image addition; it is a multimodal token in, multimodal token out. This opens up a huge array of use cases that are going to take some time to filter into the consciousness.”', 'GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo performance levels in English text and coding tasks but outshines significantly in non-English languages, making it a more inclusive and versatile model. It sets a new benchmark in reasoning with a high score of 88.7% on 0-shot COT MMLU (general knowledge questions) and 87.2% on the 5-shot no-CoT MMLU.', 'The model also excels in audio and translation benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models like Whisper-v3. In multilingual and vision evaluations, it demonstrates superior performance, enhancing OpenAI’s multilingual, audio, and vision capabilities.', 'OpenAI has incorporated robust safety measures into GPT-4o by design, incorporating techniques to filter training data and refining behaviour through post-training safeguards. The model has been assessed through a Preparedness Framework and complies with OpenAI’s voluntary commitments. Evaluations in areas like cybersecurity, persuasion, and model autonomy indicate that GPT-4o does not exceed a ‘Medium’ risk level across any category.', 'Further safety assessments involved extensive external red teaming with over 70 experts in various domains, including social psychology, bias, fairness, and misinformation. This comprehensive scrutiny aims to mitigate risks introduced by the new modalities of GPT-4o.', 'Starting today, GPT-4o’s text and image capabilities are available in ChatGPT—including a free tier and extended features for Plus users. A new Voice Mode powered by GPT-4o will enter alpha testing within ChatGPT Plus in the coming weeks.', 'Developers can access GPT-4o through the API for text and vision tasks, benefiting from its doubled speed, halved price, and enhanced rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo.', 'OpenAI plans to expand GPT-4o’s audio and video functionalities to a select group of trusted partners via the API, with broader rollout expected in the near future. This phased release strategy aims to ensure thorough safety and usability testing before making the full range of capabilities publicly available.', '“It’s hugely significant that they’ve made this model available for free to everyone, as well as making the API 50% cheaper. That is a massive increase in accessibility,” explained Whittemore.', 'OpenAI invites community feedback to continuously refine GPT-4o, emphasising the importance of user input in identifying and closing gaps where GPT-4 Turbo might still outperform.', '(Image Credit: OpenAI)', 'See also: OpenAI takes steps to boost AI-generated content transparency', 'Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

"Explained: GPT-4o, OpenAI’s newest AI model that makes ChatGPT smarter and free for all",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHBsYWluZWQvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXNjaS10ZWNoL2dwdC00by1vcGVuYWktbmV3LWFpLW1vZGVsLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy05MzI3NDA3L9IBdGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHBsYWluZWQvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXNjaS10ZWNoL2dwdC00by1vcGVuYWktbmV3LWFpLW1vZGVsLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy05MzI3NDA3L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['OpenAI introduced its latest large language model (LLM) called GPT-4o on Monday (May 13), billing it as their fastest and most powerful AI model so far. The company claims that the new model will make ChatGPT smarter and easier to use.', 'Until now, OpenAI’s most advanced LLM was the GPT-4, which was only available to paid users. However, the GPT-4o will be freely available.', 'GPT-4o (“o” stands for “Omni” here) is being seen as a revolutionary AI model, which has been developed to enhance human-computer interactions. It lets users input any combination of text, audio, and image and receive responses in the same formats. This makes GPT-4o a multimodal AI model – a significant leap from previous models.', 'Describing the new model, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati said that it was the first time that OpenAI was making a huge step forward when it came to ease of use.', 'Based on the live demos, GPT-4o seems like ChatGPT transformed into a digital personal assistant that can assist users with a variety of tasks. From real-time translations to reading a user’s face and having real-time spoken conversations, this new model is far ahead of its peers.', 'GPT-4o is capable of interacting using text and vision, meaning it can view screenshots, photos, documents, or charts uploaded by users and have conversations about them. OpenAI said that the new updated version of ChatGPT will also have updated memory capabilities and will learn from previous conversations with users.', 'LLMs are the backbone of AI chatbots. Large amounts of data are fed into these models to make them capable of learning things themselves.', 'Unlike its predecessors that required multiple models to handle different tasks, GPT-4o uses a single model trained end-to-end across various modalities – text, vision, and audio. To illustrate this, Murati explained the voice mode on previous models, which was a combination of three different models – transcription, intelligence, and text-to-speech. With GPT-4o, all of this happens natively.', 'Essentially, this means the GPT-4o comes with an integration that allows it to process and understand inputs more holistically. For example, GPT-4o can understand tone, background noises, and emotional context in audio inputs at once. These abilities were a big challenge for earlier models.', 'When it comes to features and abilities, GPT-4o excels in areas like speed and efficiency as it responds to queries as fast as a human does in conversation, in around 232 to 320 milliseconds. This is a big leap over previous models, which came with response times of up to several seconds.', 'It comes with multilingual support, and shows significant improvements in handling non-English text, making it more accessible to a global audience.', 'The GPT-4o also features enhanced audio and vision understanding. During the demo session at the live event, ChatGPT solved a linear equation in real-time when the user was writing it on paper. It could gauge the emotions of the speaker on camera and identify objects.', 'Why does it matter?', 'It comes at a time when the AI race is intensifying, with tech giants Meta and Google working towards building more powerful LLMs and bringing them to various products. GPT-4o could be beneficial for Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI, as it can now embed the model in its existing services.', 'The new model also came a day ahead of the Google I/O developer conference, where Google is expected to announce new updates to its Gemini AI model. Similar to GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini is also expected to be multimodal. Further, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June, announcements on incorporating AI in iPhones or iOS updates are expected.', 'GPT-4o will be made available to the public in stages. Text and image capabilities are already rolling out on ChatGPT, with some services available to free users. Audio and video functionalities will come gradually to developers and selected partners, ensuring that each modality (voice, text-to-speech, vision) meets the necessary safety standards before full release.', 'Although it is claimed to be the most advanced model, GPT-4o is not without limitations. On its official blog, OpenAI said that GPT-4o is still in the early stages of exploring the potential of unified multimodal interaction, meaning certain features like audio outputs are initially accessible in a limited form only, with preset voices.', 'The company said that further development and updates are necessary to fully realise its potential in handling complex multimodal tasks seamlessly.', 'When it comes to safety, OpenAI said that GPT-4o comes with built-in safety measures, including “filtered training data, and refined model behaviour post training”. The company claimed that the new model has undergone extensive safety evaluations and external reviews, focussing on risks like cybersecurity, misinformation, and bias.', 'As of now, while GPT-4o scores only a Medium-level risk across these areas, OpenAI said that continuous efforts are in place to identify and mitigate emerging risks.', ""Bijin Jose, an Assistant Editor at Indian Express Online in New Delhi, is a technology journalist with a portfolio spanning various prestigious publications.

The most significant update is the ability for users to talk in real-time with ChatGPT — it can respond in 320 milliseconds on average, OpenAI said, which makes for more natural interactions.', 'Users can also show it live video through the ChatGPT app, or via a screen-sharing function using the desktop app.', 'OpenAI also upgraded the model’s ability to communicate in non-English languages; during a live demo, the chatbot acted as a real-time English-to-Italian translator.', 'The new version will be available to all ChatGPT users, but paid subscribers will have higher message limits.', 'OpenAI is at the fore of AI development, but the new model signals the company’s push to stay on top. Voice recognition and response is an especially competitive sector: OpenAI’s competitor, Google, is holding an event Tuesday in which it could announce a new virtual voice assistant, while Apple is expected to debut a more conversational, AI-powered version of Siri in June.', 'Supported by', 'Insights from the Atlantic Council, Just Security, and Carnegie Politika', 'Sign up for Semafor Flagship: The daily global news briefing you can trust. Read it now.', 'US officials warned Tuesday that Washington could hit Georgian politicians with sanctions in response to a contentious “foreign agent law,” which passed in Georgia’s parliament after weeks of mass protests in Tbilisi and strong international condemnation.', '“If the law goes forward out of conformity with EU norms and there is undermining of democracy here and there is violence against peaceful protesters then we will see restrictions coming from the United States,” US assistant secretary of state James O’Brien told a press conference in Tbilisi, mentioning potential financial and travel restrictions on individuals.', 'He also said the US could reconsider the $390 million in assistance it plans to send to Georgia “if we are now regarded as an adversary and not a partner.”', 'If enacted, the bill would require advocacy organizations, NGOs, and media outlets that receive more than 20% of funding from overseas to register as “pursuing the interests of a foreign power.” Critics say the Russian-style law could be used to muffle critical voices.', 'After passing through parliament on Tuesday, the bill now goes to Georgia’s president, who has vowed to veto it. But Georgia’s parliament — where the bill passed 84-30 — can override that veto with a simple majority. The ruling Georgian Dream politicians have said they expect the bill to be law by the end of May.', 'Few countries have expressed so strong a desire to join the EU as Georgia, which has enshrined its goal to join Europe and NATO in its constitution. For Georgia’s strongly pro-Europe youth, EU membership has come to represent a new political direction embracing equality, human rights, and shedding the country’s post-Soviet identity, one political scientist wrote for Carnegie’s blog Strategic Europe. But European officials have said the planned legislation could scupper Georgia’s EU candidacy, arguing that its restrictions on civil society are incompatible with European values. While Georgian Dream continues to say it aims to take the country into Europe, protesters believe the party is “carrying out orders from the Kremlin and see the law as a deliberate attempt to spoil Georgia’s bid to join Europe,” The Economist reported.', 'Experts argued the legislation moves Georgia further from Europe and deeper into Russia’s orbit. European officials have repeatedly warned the bill is not compatible with Georgia’s ambitions to join the EU; more than 80% of Georgians support membership. Yet Georgia’s ruling party, Georgian Dream, has gradually moved the country closer to Moscow, opting out of Western sanctions on Russia, supporting the relocation of Russian companies to Georgia, and resuming direct flights from Moscow to Tbilisi, one expert at the Atlantic Council wrote. With elections due in October, weakening an independent civil society and building ties with Russia may ultimately forge a path for Georgian Dream to retain power indefinitely, two former US officials wrote in Just Security.', 'Human rights groups have been united and clear in their strong opposition to the legislation. “They intend to marginalize and stifle critical voices in the country that are fundamental for any functioning democracy,” Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch said in a statement. While the bill’s supporters say it is modeled on the United States’ Foreign Agent Registration Act, the US law is designed to regulate lobbyists and does not suggest any group that receives foreign funding is under the control of a foreign state, Human Rights Watch noted. “All similar initiatives in the post-Soviet space — first in Russia, and then in Kyrgyzstan — have only had a detrimental impact on rights and freedoms,” an expert wrote in Carnegie Politika.', 'Supported by', 'Insights from The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC News', 'Sign up for Semafor Flagship: The daily global news briefing you can trust. Read it now.', 'In his second day of testimony at Donald Trump’s criminal trial, former ally Michael Cohen said he committed several federal crimes to protect Trump, including lying to Congress “out of loyalty.” He also lied about the true nature of the hush-money payments at the center of the trial, he told the jury — that is, until he decided he could not lie any more, he said.', 'Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney and right-hand-man, also testified that the former president was directly involved in falsifying business records to reimburse him for a $130,000 payment — made to keep porn star Stormy Daniels quiet about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump and protect him ahead of the 2016 election.', 'Cohen’s testimony is vital to the prosecution’s allegations that Trump didn’t just falsify business records to conceal the payments, but did so as part of a broader conspiracy to get himself elected president in 2016.', 'Cohen, who will be the prosecution’s final witness, offers perhaps the most direct evidence to suggest Trump knew about the scheme and falsified the documents with that knowledge — the former president has repeatedly denied the allegations. The defense began a fiery cross-examination of Cohen on Tuesday, which will resume on Thursday.', 'As crucial as the disbarred attorney is to the prosecution, he is a star witness with a credibility problem. Prosecutors sought to get ahead of Trump’s defense cross-examination by airing Cohen’s dirty laundry themselves, but it’s a risky legal strategy.', 'Trump’s gag order stipulates he cannot make — or direct others to make — statements about the prosecutors, jury, witnesses, or judge’s family. But a parade of vice-presidential hopefuls and prominent Republicans — including House Speaker Mike Johnson — have beelined to Manhattan to act as his megaphone. Some court-watchers have pointed out that helping Trump seemingly skirt his gag order is “a dicey dance.” Asked Tuesday if he was “directing surrogates to speak on [his] behalf,” Trump told reporters he has “a lot of surrogates” who are “speaking beautifully.” But so long as Trump does not directly tell those ‘surrogates’ to sound off, “they can say whatever they want to say,” one former federal prosecutor said.', 'Trump’s inflammatory comments about the judges across his various ongoing trials are “inspiring widespread calls for violence,” a Reuters investigation has found. For example, after the former president railed against hush-money trial Judge Juan Merchan, who is not protected under the gag order, some Trump supporters called for Merchan’s execution on social media. Trump has not directly called for violence, but experts told Reuters that his language threatens the legitimacy of the independent judiciary. Anyone who crosses Trump can expect to face a barrage of threats, and two judges overseeing Trump’s other cases have recently been targeted in swatting incidents. That raises concerns that Trump’s verbal attacks are no longer “dog whistles” but “bullhorns” to his supporters, one expert told MSNBC.', 'Trump is bound to a New York courtroom several days a week, somewhat curtailing his campaign activity, while incumbent President Joe Biden can campaign all over the US as much as he pleases. But battleground-state polling hasn’t shifted much in Biden’s favor since Trump’s trial began, indicating that the former president’s legal woes have done little to boost Biden with undecided voters, many of whom say they’re most concerned with the cost of living, immigration, and Israel’s war in Gaza. It’s still possible that a Trump conviction could tip the scale: Polls suggest a fifth of Trump supporters would reconsider or withdraw support if he is convicted of a crime — enough to make a difference in what is expected to be a nail-biter election.', 'Supported by', 'E&E News, The Economist, The New York Times', '', 'Sign up for Semafor Net Zero: The nexus of politics, tech, and energy. Read it now.', 'On Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced a hike in trade tariffs for $18 billion worth of Chinese goods — most notably green tech like electric vehicles and solar panels. The move is widely seen as an attempt to undercut Republican calls to limit Chinese goods stifling American competition, but it could also hurt Democrats’ promise of modernizing the country’s electricity grid.', 'Just on Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — an independent agency that oversees interstate energy transmission — introduced new rules that require grid managers and electricity providers to and plan 20 years ahead: Essentially requiring developers to upgrade their existing infrastructure or build new lines designed for renewable energy sources. And in a separate rule, the agency can now issue permits for new transmission lines, circumventing resistance from Republican states that don’t support the green energy transmission.', 'The new rules underscore a flashpoint in the energy policy debate between Republicans and Democrats, even as the US’ outdated energy infrastructure becomes increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity risks and general wear and tear.', 'Analysts said that the US commitment to green energy will only be delayed if the White House continues implementing protectionist trade policies on renewable energy.', 'The latest tariff hike on Chinese green tech effectively eliminates Chinese competition from the US market. The move could help Biden get support in Rust Belt states that could lead in manufacturing domestic green tech; but the tariffs also underscore “deep tensions” in Biden’s agenda between delivering well-paying jobs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to E&E news. While Chinese EVs are virtually non-existent on US roads, the new duties on solar panels may discourage consumers from buying panels, and keep them reliant on fossil fuels. They could also give domestic producers “less of an incentive to develop cheap goods in the long term” if they are shielded from foreign competition, according to The Economist. In contrast, Donald Trump has promised to hike tariffs on all foreign goods if elected that would hurt consumers even more if enacted.', 'When two Republican FERC members left their seats this year, Sen. Majority leader Chuck Schumer pounced at the opportunity and put pressure on the Democratic majority of the agency to enact the new transmission rules, the New York Times Times reported. Ultimately, the FERC is at the center of the energy policy tug-of-war between Democrats and Republicans — and particularly at the state level. Republicans want legislation to fast track permits for fossil fuel projects and pipelines. To that end, they have stalled legislation in Congress that would modernize the grid and help bring renewable energy online. Republicans are “against [transmission] just to be against Biden,” former FERC chair Neil Chatterjee told the Times.', 'The electrical grid is largely unable to reroute electricity quickly, which is a vital safety feature needed to accommodate fluctuating sources of renewable energy. But beyond hardware, the grid’s aging software makes it particularly susceptible to cyberattacks: The North American Electric Reliability Corporation last month estimated there are 60 new vulnerable points added to the grid every day, Reuters reported. These physical or digital weak spots are doors for hackers to inject malware and shut down portions of the grid, and cybersecurity experts are particularly concerned about Russia and China exploiting these vulnerabilities to cause massive blackouts across the country. Indeed, the Corporation said that the grid is particularly at risk as the US heads toward the upcoming election.', 'Supported by', 'Insights from The Neuron, One Useful Thing, and The Verge', 'Sign up for Semafor Technology: What’s next in the new era of tech.

But the announcement was quickly followed by Google on Tuesday, which revealed it will integrate its flagship AI Gemini into Google Search and teased new voice and video chatbot features.', 'Meanwhile, Apple is racing to make upgrades to its AI assistant, Siri, to compete with its rivals’ latest offerings.', 'The flurry of updates follows the release of the buzzy — but criticized — Rabbit R1 personal assistant and the Humane AI pin. Ultimately the latest phase in the AI race could reshape how we find out new information online and language translation — and even change the phone in your pocket.', 'The latest integrations of AI into search engines and vice-versa moves the online ecosystem closer to a system where AI makes search engines obsolete. Google announced plans to effectively fuse search and AI, rolling out its AI-generated summaries, known as “AI Overviews,” will be available to everyone in the US this week. But creators and publishers are worried the changes will crater their web traffic, with traditional search links replaced by the summaries, The Washington Post reported. Research firm Gartner predicts search web traffic will fall 25 percent by 2026; a search consultant told the Post: “Some people are going to just get bludgeoned.”', 'OpenAI’s newest model, GPT-4o, can respond to a user’s voice prompts within an average of 320 milliseconds: “It’s uncannily human-like, perhaps too much so,” AI-focused newsletter The Neuron wrote. “But it means that for tasks you’d normally attempt with Siri, you should use ChatGPT instead.” The new features seem geared toward making AI more connected to human systems, which could give it more real-world application, AI scholar Ethan Mollick wrote. “This is where AI labs are leading us: to a near future of AI as coworker, friend, and ubiquitous presence.”', 'Tech companies are increasingly looking for ways to integrate AI into hardware. Fast Company wrote at the beginning of the year that 2024 would see AI “become an integral part of smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets.” Both the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 received mostly negative reviews, with The Verge’s David Pierce predicting new ways to “interact with AI on your phone,” like high-tech headphones or smartwatches. Google and Apple could have a head start in that space, since they already make phones that have some level of AI integration.

Police also arrested two radio journalists for their comments on air as well as social media posts, according to their lawyers.', 'They are the latest among the dozens of lawyers and journalists who have been detained under Decree 54, a law introduced by Tunisia’s President Kaies Saied in 2022. The law was designed to combat cybercrime and misinformation, but it is increasingly being used to silence the president’s critics.', 'Saied was elected in 2019 in the country’s second presidential election after the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings. But he shut down parliament and assumed authority over the judiciary in 2021, a move the opposition calls a coup.', 'The arrests also come as more Tunisians are taking to the street to demand Saied set a date for this year’s presidential elections, a delay that opposition party members have also criticized him for.', '', 'In an analysis of the Presidential Decree-Law 2022-54, known as Decree 54, Tunisian non-profit media collective Inkyfada described the law’s use as a “witch hunt.” The outlet reported more than twenty cases from 2023 in which journalists, lawyers, politicians, academics, and activists were detained for comments they posted online or made to the media. “No one is safe,” the president of the National Union of Tunisian Journalists said, “this type of surveillance is life threatening.” The International Commission of Jurists, an advocacy group based in Geneva, noted the law’s criminalization of “fake news” and “rumors” are overbroad and vague, constituting a “serious threat to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.”', 'Tunisia’s main opposition coalition in parliament, the National Salvation Front, announced a boycott of this year’s presidential elections, which have not yet been scheduled. “The Front rejects participation in any electoral charade due to the absence of conditions for fair and democratic elections,” coalition leaders said, and called for the release of political opponents and reinstatement of Tunisia’s judiciary. At least seven candidates — many jailed in Tunisia or exiled abroad — have said they will run, declarations that local outlet Tunigate said are designed to “embarrass President Kais Saied to remove the ambiguity of the election date.” Foreign Policy’s Allison Meakem said it’s difficult to gauge how many Tunisians support the president, as opposition boycotts of parliamentary elections made “the results almost comically lopsided.”', 'Located just 130 kilometers offshore of Italian islands like Lampedusa, the Tunisian city of Sfax is a hub for both Tunisians and Sub-Saharan migrants attempting to cross into Europe. President Saied has pushed for the deportation of migrants, authorized camp sweeps and activist arrests, while tensions have risen domestically as Tunisians increasingly compete with refugees and migrants for resources and jobs. The EU has a stake: The bloc signed a €105 million border management deal with Tunisia in 2023, a move that Amnesty International’s European director called “deeply immoral.” Meanwhile, one analyst from the European Council on Foreign Relations noted the deal is “designed to keep migrants and refugees out of the EU, not Tunisia itself.”', 'Supported by', 'Insights from the South China Morning Post, The Sunday Times, and The Spectator', 'Sign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading.

That’s significant because Hong Kong’s economic and trade policy has been left largely free of Chinese influence under its “one government, two systems” model — but the arrest suggests that freedom waning.', 'Meanwhile, British authorities have been ramping up counter-espionage operations targeting suspected Chinese spies — including a former Conservative parliamentary researcher — in recent weeks; Beijing has largely condemned and denied the accusations.', 'That a Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office official was arrested for espionage could spark questions about the independence of the city’s foreign trade offices, effectively shutting down the last branch of autonomy Hong Kong has over its external affairs, according to the South China Morning Post. While Hong Kong’s National Security Law means that Beijing now largely controls the city’s legislative and judicial systems, the city has been able to maintain some economic autonomy and organize its trade deals independently of Beijing. But the spying incidents will push China hawks in the UK and abroad to “demand authorities to review the relevant acts governing the operation of the trade offices in their countries,” one Hong Kong-based international relations academic said.', 'UK universities are a target of Chinese espionage, according to UK intelligence. Chinese researchers are recruited by Beijing “to steal technology” for military purposes, reported freelance journalist and frequent CNN commentator Latika Bourke. University staff could soon be required to have security clearance because it’s so pervasive, she added. In turn,Beijing funds hundreds of scholarships to send Chinese students to UK universities and monitor dissident activity on campus, according to a Scottish intelligence report. Several academics interviewed by the Sunday Times recalled Chinese students who questioned their political beliefs, with some staff alleging the students reported them to China’s embassy.', 'Beijing has historically relied on its huge diaspora worldwide for espionage, and Chinese spy agencies “used to be circumspect about recruiting foreigners and using techniques such as honey-traps,” former MI6 director Nigel Inkster wrote in The Spectator. But with more dissidents becoming vocal within the Chinese community abroad — and the West becoming more suspicious of China-born individuals — Beijing is increasingly relying on foreigners for espionage. Many of these Western agents are recruited while studying abroad or working in China.

Beijing has operated as a lifeline for Moscow, which has been penalized for its invasion of Ukraine through widespread Western sanctions.', 'The US recently agreed a $61 billion aid package for Kyiv that includes air defense interceptors, artillery, and long-range ATACMS missiles.', 'Ukraine has been less successful at fending off Russian missile strikes in recent months, a New York Times analysis found. The Russian military has “improved its tactics, firing larger and more complex barrages,” the report said, and Ukraine’s shortage of reliable ammunition or defenses has meant that it can’t properly defend itself. Moscow has also upped its offensive on the country’s eastern front, targeting communities that faced the initial invasion in 2022. Residents are fleeing en masse from their homes, and believe that Russia is making a run at taking the city of Kharkiv, located just 25 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.', 'Russia’s economy has survived Western sanctions, and in a surprise cabinet reshuffle over the weekend Putin appointed an economist as the new defense minister — a move viewed as an attempt to emphasize the Kremlin’s focus on curbing runaway wartime spending. The US has repeatedly threatened to crack down on Beijing for sending supplies to Russia that could aid its war effort, but Xi seems to be strengthening his relationship with Putin. “Russia is fundamental to China’s grand strategy,” Manoj Kewalramani, head of Indo-Pacific studies at the Bangalore-based Takshashila Institution, told CNN. Xi may be trying to avoid escalating tensions with the West, but “there is a deep interest in making sure that Russia doesn’t lose the war,” he said.', 'China has closely watched the US impose sanctions against Russian banks following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Washington targeted the Russian elites’ dollar-based assets — a move that alarmed Beijing, which has sought to find ways of circumventing a similar financial crisis. Sanctions are being deployed by Western nations against nations or individuals, sparking “an unprecedented surge in financial warfare,” The Economist noted. As a result, nations are becoming adept at finding a way around sanctions. Western countries “must contend with the growing prosperity and financial sophistication of ‘third countries’ — ones that neither impose American and European sanctions, nor are under sanctions themselves,” the outlet added.', '']"

The model is said to be faster and have enhanced capabilities across text, vision, and audio. The new model will be rolled out to all ChatGPT users, both free and paid, over the next few weeks.', 'In a live streamed presentation, OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati explained that the ""o"" in GPT-4o stands for ""omnimodel,"" meaning that it is a multimodal tool with vision and audio capabilities natively built in. Previously, for ChatGPT to process images or audio, OpenAI would string multiple models together, all of which were specialized for a different media type, or ""modality."" Stringing these models together led to significant lag times, but by combining all the modalities into a single model, the process is made much faster. For example, the new model can translate a conversation between two people speaking different languages in real time, without any lag for loading or processing. ', 'Article continues after sponsored content', 'A Road Map to a Billion: Reflections From a Unicorn Founder', ""Murati also announced that GPT-4o will be available for commercial use through OpenAI's API, and will boast speeds up to two times faster than the company's previous flagship offering, GPT-4 Turbo. Murati also said that GPT-4o will be 50 percent cheaper. On OpenAI's website, GPT-4o is listed as costing $5 for every one million tokens input into the model, and $15 for every one million tokens output by the model. Although the new model is faster and cheaper, it has a knowledge cutoff date of October 2023, meaning it hasn't been trained on any data since that point. "", '""Our developers can start building today with GPT-4o to make amazing AI applications and deploy them at scale,"" said Murati. ', ""Murati brought on a pair of OpenAI researchers, who showed off GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities by having a natural language conversation with that chatbot. One of the researchers asked the voice-based version of ChatGPT to create a bedtime story, and was able to interrupt the chatbot to make edits, like asking for a more dramatic telling of the story. Murati interjected, asking if that chatbot could take on a robotic voice, which it immediately did. "", ""The researchers also showed off how the model can combine text, audio, and video all at the same time. While using the audio version of ChatGPT, the researchers used their phone's camera to show ChatGPT a simple math equation. The app was able to help the researcher solve the problem just through hints. "", 'Murati closed out the event by thanking Jensen Huang and the Nvidia team for providing them with ""the most advanced GPUs to make this demo possible today."" She also said that GPT-4o will be rolled out over the next few weeks, and teased the much-anticipated release of GPT-5, saying ""soon we\'ll be updating you on our progress to the next big thing.""

We sat down with Marshall, an Adobe Acrobat partner, to hear about how her content and business have evolved, as well as the role AI has played in helping her be her most productive.', 'Q: How did the Corporate Natalie persona come to be? ', 'A: Like many people, the culture of remote work the pandemic created made me reflect on this new (and, at the time, bizarre) way of working--video conference etiquette, the personas of different coworkers, and of course, balancing my work and personal life from the same spot in my house every day. I started to tap into these shared feelings about WFH and “Corporate Natalie” was born. ', 'There’s a lot of content out there now about corporate life these days, but it was only a few years ago when that kind of material was new, exciting, and risky. Looking back at many of the comments in my videos, I started to realize that I’m almost trauma-bonded with my followers based on my experiences working in that culture--the oversharing coworker, the boss who’s never at their desk, even bad Wi-Fi connections. It was comforting to see how many of my followers felt the same.', 'Q: How has your content and your business evolved (or stayed the same) since the pandemic’s early days? ', 'A: Once folks started returning to the office, so did Corporate Natalie. I then started to focus on pivoting my content to the changing times. These days, I’m creating more content about “just” Natalie, sans the “corporate.” For example, I’ve been posting more about my workouts and travels, and have even launched a new vlog series--“Day in My Silly Little Life”--with the same playful humor that my followers recognize. ', 'While my life--and by extension, my content--has changed quite a bit since the early days of the pandemic, what hasn’t changed is my hands-on approach when it comes to the business of content creation like brand partnerships. Ironically, this work keeps me close to the corporate world, giving me new inspiration for Corporate Natalie daily.', 'Q: You mentioned the “business of content creation.” What role does Document AI play in helping you manage everything associated with running a business and creating content? ', 'A: I recently had an opportunity to partner with Adobe on creating content for the new Adobe Acrobat AI Assistant. We don’t use a traditional talent agency to handle logistics of Corporate Natalie brand deals, so throughout that work with Adobe, I started to realize how AI can help me and my brand manager, Annie, handle the front- and back-end business of content creation.', 'Q: In what ways? ', 'A: Most of the important documents we review daily are in PDF, and reviewing contracts and dense creative briefs can take up a lot of time. It’s easy to miss things when you’re given a 45-page document to read, review, and redline. Acrobat AI Assistant helps me go in, ask questions, and make sure we’re hitting all the sections that matter to us. It’s been an absolute time saver! The generative summary capability in Acrobat AI Assistant also creates short, easy-to-read overviews of the content inside these long and complex briefs. ', 'Also, as soon as I started running this business, I quickly realized that I had to let go of certain administrative tasks to free up creative time. It was during an Intro to Accounting class in my undergraduate business school when I had the epiphany that I never want to be an accountant, so the first thing I did when I started this business was outsource accounting to an actual CPA. When it comes to collaborating with my partners and potential partners, I lean on AI to consolidate and format information into top takeaways, text for emails, presentations, and reports. AI has also been helpful for summarizing my podcast episodes to generate episode summaries.', 'Q: Have there been any unexpected ways that AI has helped you? ', ""A: Interestingly, it’s helped me find inspiration for creating new videos. Corporate culture I know. But Gen Z culture? That’s a little trickier. We’ll occasionally use AI to help with developing a script that we're working on, or if we’re doing [a video about] a certain type of person. AI can also help us grab insights and provide short overviews from long research documents about Gen Z trends. While AI doesn’t fully understand my humor (yet), it’s a great jumping off point. "", 'Q: As a content creator, where would you like to see AI head next? ', 'A: AI has been a buzz category for a while now, but I think we’re still scratching the surface of how it can help us be our most productive. While it’s still early days, I can already see how AI provides tremendous value for me--not just now, but also tomorrow.', ' ', ' ', 'To follow Corporate Natalie’s humorous adventures juggling work and life, check out her Instagram page.
