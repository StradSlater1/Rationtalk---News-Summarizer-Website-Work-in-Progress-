But the proposal, also known as Privacy Sandbox, had instilled fears in the online advertising industry that any replacement technology would leave even less room for online ad rivals.', 'In a blog post on Monday, Google said it decided to abandon the plan after considering the impact of the changes on publishers, advertisers and ‚Äúeveryone involved in online advertising.‚Äù', ""The U.K.'s primary competition regulator, which has been involved in oversight of the Privacy Sandbox project, said Google will, instead, give users the option to block or allow third-party cookies on the browser."", 'Google will ‚Äúintroduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they‚Äôd be able to adjust that choice at any time,‚Äù Anthony Chavez, vice president of Privacy Sandbox, said in the post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out.‚Äù', 'Advertisers use cookies to target ads to web users but privacy campaigners say they can be used to track users across the internet.', ""Google first proposed scrapping cookies in 2020, but the deadline for finishing the work had slipped a few times.

The new Llama 3 model can converse in eight languages, write higher-quality computer code and solve more complex math problems than previous versions, the Facebook parent company said in blog posts and a research paper announcing the release.

Why Privacy Badger Opts You Out of Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrivacy Sandbox‚Äù,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmZi5vcmcvZGVlcGxpbmtzLzIwMjQvMDcvd2h5LXByaXZhY3ktYmFkZ2VyLW9wdHMteW91LW91dC1nb29nbGVzLXByaXZhY3ktc2FuZGJveNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"[""Update July 22, 2024: Shortly after we published this post, Google announced it's no longer deprecating third-party cookies in Chrome. We've updated this blog to note the news."", 'The latest update of Privacy Badger opts users out of ad tracking through Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrivacy Sandbox.‚Äù ', 'Privacy Sandbox is Google‚Äôs way of letting advertisers keep targeting ads based on your online behavior without using third-party cookies. Third-party cookies were once the most common form of online tracking technology, but major browsers, like Safari and Firefox, started blocking them several years ago. After pledging to eventually do the same for Chrome in 2020, and after several delays, today Google backtracked on its privacy promise, announcing that third-party cookies are here to stay. Notably, Google Chrome continues to lag behind other browsers in terms of default protections against online tracking.', ""Privacy Sandbox might be less invasive than third-party cookies, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good for your privacy. Instead of eliminating online tracking, Privacy Sandbox simply shifts control of online tracking from third-party trackers to Google. With Privacy Sandbox, tracking will be done by your Chrome browser itself, which shares insights gleaned from your browsing habits with different websites and advertisers. Despite sounding like a feature that protects your privacy, Privacy Sandbox ultimately protects Google's advertising business."", '', 'How did Google get users to go along with this? In 2023, Chrome users received a pop-up about ‚ÄúEnhanced ad privacy in Chrome.‚Äù In the U.S., if you clicked the ‚ÄúGot it‚Äù button to make the pop-up go away, Privacy Sandbox remained enabled for you by default. Users could opt out by changing three settings in Chrome. But first, they had to realize that ""Enhanced ad privacy"" actually enabled a new form of ad tracking.', ""You shouldn't have to read between the lines of Google‚Äôs privacy-washing language to protect your privacy. Privacy Badger will do this for you!"", 'If you use Google Chrome, Privacy Badger will update three different settings that constitute Privacy Sandbox:', '', 'Ad topics: This setting allows Google to generate a list of topics you‚Äôre interested in based on the websites you visit. Any site you visit can ask Chrome what topics you‚Äôre supposedly into, then display an ad accordingly. Some of the potential topics‚Äìlike ‚ÄúStudent Loans & College Financing‚Äù, ‚ÄúCredit Reporting & Monitoring‚Äù, and ‚ÄúUnwanted Body & Facial Hair Removal‚Äù‚Äìcould serve as proxies for sensitive financial or health information, potentially enabling predatory ad targeting. In an attempt to prevent advertisers from identifying you, your topics roll over each week and Chrome includes a random topic 5% of the time. However, researchers found that Privacy Sandbox topics could be used to re-identify users across websites. Using 1,207 people‚Äôs real browsing histories, researchers showed that as few as three observations of a person‚Äôs ‚Äúad topics‚Äù was enough to identify 60% of users across different websites.', 'Site-suggested ads: This setting enables ""remarketing"" or ""retargeting,"" which is the reason you‚Äôre constantly seeing ads for things you just shopped for online. It works by allowing any site you visit to give information (like ‚Äúthis person loves sofas‚Äù) to your Chrome browser. Then when you visit a site that runs ads, Chrome uses that information to help the site display a sofa ad without the site learning that you love sofas. However, researchers demonstrated this feature of Privacy Sandbox could be exploited to re-identify and track users across websites, partially infer a user‚Äôs browsing history, and manipulate the ads that other sites show a user.', ""Ad measurement: This setting allows advertisers to track ad performance by storing data in your browser that's then shared with the advertised sites. For example, after you see an ad for shoes, whenever you visit that shoe site it‚Äôll get information about the time of day the ad was shown and where the ad was displayed. Unfortunately, Google allows advertisers to include a unique ID with this data. So if you interact with multiple ads from the same advertiser around the web, this ID can help an advertiser build a profile of your browsing habits."", 'Privacy Badger is committed to protecting you from online tracking. Despite being billed as a privacy feature, Privacy Sandbox protects Google‚Äôs bottom line at the expense of your privacy. Nearly 80% of Google‚Äôs revenue comes from online advertising. By building ad tracking into your Chrome browser, Privacy Sandbox gives Google even more control of the advertising ecosystem than it already has. Yet again, Google is rewriting the rules for the internet in a way that benefits itself first.', 'Researchers and regulators have already found that Privacy Sandbox ‚Äúfails to meet its own privacy goals.‚Äù In a draft report leaked to the Wall Street Journal, the UK‚Äôs privacy regulator noted that Privacy Sandbox could be exploited to identify anonymous users and that companies will likely use it to continue tracking users across sites. Likewise, after researchers told Google about 12 attacks they conducted on a key feature of Privacy Sandbox prior to its public release, Google forged ahead and released the feature after mitigating only one of those attacks.', 'Privacy Sandbox offers some privacy improvements over third-party cookies. But it reinforces Google‚Äôs commitment to behavioral advertising, something we‚Äôve been advocating against for years. Behavioral advertising incentivizes online actors to collect as much of our information as possible. This can lead to a range of harms, like bad actors buying your sensitive information and predatory ads targeting vulnerable populations.', ""Your browser shouldn‚Äôt put advertisers' interests above yours. As Google turns your browser into an advertising agent, Privacy Badger will put your privacy first."", 'If you don‚Äôt already have Privacy Badger, install it now to automatically opt out of Privacy Sandbox and the broader ecosystem of online tracking. Already have Privacy Badger? You‚Äôre all set! And of course, don‚Äôt hesitate to spread the word to friends and family you want to protect from invasive online tracking.

If the whole saga of third-party cookies has taught ad execs anything, it‚Äôs to expect the unexpected.', 'In the meantime, ad execs can expect Google to put on a full-court press to sell the Sandbox.

Their faith in the Privacy Sandbox has been waning over the past several months. Execs told Digiday that only being able to test the Sandbox on 1% of Chrome users made the experimentation pool too small to draw definitive conclusions on its performance. Then in April, when Google announced it was delaying the deprecation of third-party cookies again, several publishers said they stopped allocating further resources to testing the sandbox altogether.', 'Some media execs told Digiday at the time that they were still allowing larger entities like Criteo and Index Exchange to use their inventory for larger scaled tests, but once their findings were published earlier this summer, the publishers realized that the juice wasn‚Äôt worth the squeeze when it came to performing any tests in-house.

So it‚Äôs now changing tack, which will see an all-new data privacy approach from the app.', 'What form that will take is not clear as yet, but as Google notes, it‚Äôll be based around user choice, and empowering each individual to limit what data they share.', 'That, based on historical evidence, could end up being a big win for advertisers, as most users simply won‚Äôt make any changes to their settings.

It depends. Are you an internet user who cares about privacy? An internet publisher who cares about making money? Or somewhere in between?', 'On Monday afternoon, Google shocked the online-advertising world by saying that, actually, despite years of promises, it wouldn‚Äôt be dropping cookies from its world-dominant web browser, Chrome. If you‚Äôre not deep into the surveillance-capitalism game, here‚Äôs Richard Lawler at The Verge to explain:', '', '', 'Now, Chrome will ask users to ‚Äúmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing‚Äù instead of deprecating third-party cookies, writes Google Privacy Sandbox VP Anthony Chavez. That could work more like Apple‚Äôs app tracking opt-in, a setting that reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion when it rolled out in 2021. Putting a prompt in front of Chrome‚Äôs billions of users wouldn‚Äôt be as drastic as changing the default entirely, but it still might cut the number of users allowing third-party tracking significantly.', '', 'Some background. The issue here rests on the uncomfortable truth that publishers‚Äô ad revenue depends heavily on being able to know enough about their users to serve them a useful ad ‚Äî or, at least, an ad that seems well enough aligned to the user that an advertiser is willing to pay more for it. In general, publishers themselves don‚Äôt know this information; they instead give a substantial cut of their ad revenue to an adtech company that has this data ‚Äî the largest of these by far being Google itself. And the main way that data is gathered is via third-party cookies, the tiny data files stored in your browser that connect your activity on Sites A, B, C, and D to the same user profile.', 'These cookies are, understandably, anathema to privacy advocates. The idea that, on any given pageview, dozens of faceless companies might be updating their dossiers on your habits isn‚Äôt especially pleasant. And the two companies that had by far the largest caches of user data ‚Äî Google and Facebook/Meta ‚Äî used that setup to become the world-bestriding Duopoly they are today.', 'Enter Apple. Unlike Google and Facebook, Apple doesn‚Äôt make much of its money on selling advertising, and it considers privacy a core feature of its shiny glass rectangles. In 2020, it announced it was blocking all third-party cookies in Safari, the browser on iPhones and iPads. In 2021, it extended the system to apps by requiring users to approve (or disapprove) each app that wants to track users across the ecosystem. (You know, all those ‚ÄúAsk App Not to Track‚Äù buttons you‚Äôve tapped.) This had a major impact on the adtech world, costing Facebook literal billions. Firefox later followed suit.', 'Google said it wanted to get on board, announcing it would start blocking third-party cookies by 2022. Then it postponed it to 2023. Then 2024. Then 2025. And now, 2025‚Äôs out. How about never ‚Äî is never good for you?', 'Google proposed a number of replacements for the cookie regime over the years, most notably Privacy Sandbox, which promised cookie-like identifiability without tying the data so easily to an individual. But both competitors and regulators expressed concern that Privacy Sandbox didn‚Äôt go far enough in protecting privacy and would, in effect, lock in Google‚Äôs preeminence in online advertising. One adtech company estimated trading cookies for Privacy Sandbox would lead publishers to ‚Äúlose an average of 60% of their revenue from Chrome.‚Äù In April, U.K. regulators said that it ‚Äúleaves gaps that can be exploited to undermine privacy and identify users who should be kept anonymous.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the Electronic Frontier Foundation:', '', '', 'So we‚Äôre back at square one. Cookies aren‚Äôt going anywhere in the world‚Äôs most-used web browser. For the adtech industry, that‚Äôs a win. But if you‚Äôre an online publisher, it‚Äôs not clear how to react. The old bad system that made Google a lot of money and you a pittance‚Ä¶sticks around. Yay, maybe? ‚ÄúPhew, we dodged that somewhat-less-privacy-violating but somewhat-less-money-making-for-us alternative to our current bad setup‚Äù? Privacy Sandbox was an imperfect replacement, but no replacement at all has its problems too. Google now says it wants instead to ‚Äúelevate user choice‚Äù by letting Chrome users ‚Äúmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they‚Äôd be able to adjust that choice at any time.‚Äù That could, depending on how it‚Äôs enforced, lead to the loss of many third-party cookies ‚Äî but we have no details, only a Google promise to ‚Äúengage with the industry as we roll this out.‚Äù', 'The best solution for publishers, as always, is to work on gathering their own first-party data to allow targeting without all the privacy leaks.

Google says that, while the company still believes it can strike a balance between the online ad marketplace and user privacy, it understands the existing challenges in doing so with this many moving parts. The company says, ""this transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising.""', 'As such, Google announced it is changing tactics on its privacy plans for online advertising: While the company will be abandoning its push to retire cookies, it will be introducing a new option in Chrome that, ""lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing."" Google fell short of explaining exactly how this ""informed choice"" works, but users will have the option to change their choice at any time. The company also confirmed it is working with regulators on this feature now, and will keep the industry informed as they roll out the option to users.', 'However this feature works, putting the onus on users, rather than disabling tracking by default (which is how it works on Safari and Firefox) is a shame‚Äîespecially considering how popular Google\'s browser is. That said, it may be similar to how Apple\'s ""App Tracking Transparency"" works: You may open Chrome, and be asked whether you\'d like to block cookies from tracking your internet activity. You can then choose whether to block that tracking, or allow it. Most people, of course, will likely choose to block this tracking, as is what happened on iOS.', ""All that said, retiring cookies for good would be the optimal path for preserving user privacy on the web. While some cookies are essential for websites to run properly (they're what's responsible for keeping you logged in, remembering what's in your shopping cart, etc.), most cookies are used by advertisers and other companies to track your activity across websites. You can think of them like an ID badge, containing a ton of personal information about you, your device, and your past activity."", ""Google wanted to replace cookies with a new policy: the Privacy Sandbox. The idea is, instead of tracking individual users' activity, Google would compile your browsing data with others like it, and anonymize the bunch. Then it would share this data pool with advertisers. These companies would still get relevant data, without being able to tie it directly to you and your activity. It isn't great, since we'd still hand Google a ton of data, but it would be better than modern cookies. You can learn more about how both cookies and the Privacy Sandbox work in my explainer here."", 'Even though Google isn\'t killing cookies for good, Chrome still lets you block them if you want to. To start, go to Privacy and security in Chrome\'s Settings. Under ""Default behavior,"" choose Block third-party cookies. Just be warned without cookies enabled, some site features may not work.
