Referring to the former president as “my predecessor”, as he did repeatedly during last week’s fiery State of the Union speech, Biden condemned Trump for “making $2tn in tax cuts” during his single term, and “expanding the federal deficit”.', '“I’m not anti-corporation.

Biden has pledged to stop any cuts to Medicare.', '“The House’s budget blueprint reflects the values of hard-working Americans who know that in tough economic times, you don’t spend what you don’t have – our federal government must do the same,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said in a statement.', 'Meanwhile, Congress is still working on a budget for the current fiscal year.

The new spending proposal breaks down to $895 billion for defense spending and $734 billion for non-defense spending, 4.3% above and 3.4% below the enacted 2023 spending levels, respectively.', 'Given the current climate on Capitol Hill, the 2025 budget request is unlikely to find its way through Congress unscathed.

Military members would receive a 4.5% raise next year, according to the budget request.', 'The percentage adjustment would be the smallest pay raise since President Joe Biden took office. Federal employees received raises of 5.2%, 4.6% and 2.7%, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Now a year after Biden hinted at plans to fix the pay compression Senior Executive Service members, higher-level General Schedule employees, and blue-collar workers on the Federal Wage System experience, the White House pointed to a couple possible options to pursue. Those include increasing Executive Schedule rates, removing pay caps in the Federal Wage System and modifying how pay rates are adjusted each year.', '“The administration continues to prioritize federal compensation and also looks forward to working with Congress to address long-standing issues of pay compression, which impact employees at various levels throughout the government,” OMB said in the budget documents. “By continuing to pursue structural improvements and use of flexibilities, we will enhance the competitiveness of the federal pay system.”', 'The budget request does not detail how the raise would break down between the across-the-board percentage and locality pay adjustments.

In the proposal, the Biden administration pointed to new goals for improving the federal workforce, as well as its plans to strengthen existing goals.', 'For one, the budget request calls on agencies to improve the federal hiring process, in part through scaling up the use of shared certificates and pooled hiring. Shared certificates let federal job applicants submit one application, which multiple agencies can then consider for common positions that aren’t specific to one agency. The budget request touted success of the recruitment strategy for hiring 6,100 feds through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.', 'Additionally, the budget request maintains a focus on early-career federal hiring, which has been a priority at agencies for several years.

Notably, the budget request pushes for a permanent pay raise for federal wildland firefighters, as well as other workforce reforms for the frontline employees, including more staffing, better health services and improved housing for federal firefighters — totaling $135 million above the 2023 enacted level for the Interior Department, and $387 million over the 2023 enacted level for Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service.', 'The investments “would help address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges, increase … capacity to complete critical risk mitigation work, and further the administration’s commitment to build a more robust and resilient wildland firefighting workforce as the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires continue to increase due to climate change,” the budget request said.', 'The Transportation Security Administration would receive an additional $1.5 billion to continue funding the TSA pay equity initiative. The initiative gave TSA employees a pay raise beginning in July 2023.', '“The TSA workforce deserves to be fairly compensated at rates comparable with their peers in the federal workforce,” the budget request said. “TSA has already seen an 11% reduction in attrition, and is making gains in retaining what has historically been a workforce with high turnover.”', 'The Federal Aviation Administration would get $17.5 billion in its discretionary budget authority, according to the budget request.

It’s a high-stakes sales pitch, given polling that shows voters’ perceptions of the current economy don’t match Biden’s triumphant talking points.', 'Just the same, Biden’s latest budget request is even more of a political messaging exercise than usual. That’s because, while the new fiscal year kicks off on Oct. 1 — weeks before U.S. voters head to the polls to pick their next president — Congress is likely to punt major government funding decisions until after Election Day.', 'In keeping with the political theme, the Republican bashing in Biden’s budget isn’t subtle.', 'Here are seven ways he used his fiscal 2025 budget to ding the GOP:', 'Social Security and Medicare', 'After committing during his State of the Union address last week to “stop” anyone in Congress who tries to raise the retirement age for Social Security benefits, Biden’s budget instead calls for raising taxes on high earners to keep Social Security and Medicare from hitting insolvency within the next decade.', 'People earning more than $400,000 a year would have to pay more Medicare taxes than they do now, counting both their income and investments. Their Medicare tax rate would rise to 5 percent from 3.8 percent.', '“As the president has made clear,” Monday’s budget reads, “he will reject any efforts to cut or undermine the Medicare or Social Security benefits that seniors and people with disabilities have earned and paid into their entire working lives.”', 'Food fight ', 'When it comes to food aid for low-income families, the president’s budget plan draws a sharp contrast with Republicans – who administration officials argue are hellbent on slashing critical programs and benefits.', 'It would pour $7.7 billion into fully funding nutrition assistance for women, infants and children through the WIC program. That’s about a $700 million boost above the funding level Congress passed last week.', 'Biden is seeking that increase after GOP leaders fought against a $1 billion increase for the WIC program this month, demanding tougher restrictions on other food aid in exchange.', 'He is also pushing for an emergency fund that would give extra money to WIC when there are unexpected costs. The aid program faced a funding cliff earlier this year because of higher food prices and more people enrolling.', 'Tax cuts', 'The president’s blueprint knocks Republicans for the tax cuts for the wealthy that were a centerpiece of the tax law Trump signed in 2017.', 'Biden inherited a “fiscally irresponsible legacy,” the budget says, accusing the former president and Republicans of obscuring the deficit growth caused by their proposals, in “one of the most egregious and fiscally reckless budget decisions in modern history.”', 'That 2017 law lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Biden’s plan would raise it back up to 28 percent, while hiking the corporate minimum tax rate from 15 percent to 21 percent.', 'Biden’s budget maintains his commitment not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000. It also aims to cut taxes for low- and middle-income Americans by $765 billion over 10 years and restores a pandemic-era expansion of the Child Tax Credit.', 'Ukraine aid', 'The White House is reiterating its request for tens of billions of dollars in emergency cash for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, noting that House Republicans have not taken up the $95 billion national security spending package the Senate passed last month.', 'The budget warns that Ukraine’s battlefield needs will suffer if House GOP leaders don’t act, as will “life-saving assistance and development” for some of the “world’s most vulnerable areas.”', 'Student debt', 'The budget builds on a key tenet of Biden’s reelection platform, lauding the administration’s plans to deliver a student loan reprieve to millions of Americans, despite conservative-driven legal challenges.', 'On top of that, Biden is proposing a $12 billion fund to lower college costs, while increasing the maximum Pell Grant award by an extra $100 to help expand the reach of the program for students looking to attend a public or non-profit college.', 'Rural energy costs', 'The Biden administration budget identifies rural areas as “critical to achieving the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035.”', 'The document touts administration officials’ efforts to boost renewable energy funding for rural communities, which House Republicans recently pushed to cut.', 'Deficit reduction', 'Overall, Biden’s proposal outlines more than $1.6 trillion in discretionary funding for the coming fiscal year. That total is largely in line with the funding limits established by the debt deal that the president negotiated last summer with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy – but far more than the amount House conservatives want to see.', 'At the same time, the plan aims to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade by raising tax rates on large corporations, cracking down on fraud and requiring billionaires to pay at least 25 percent of their income on taxes, among other revenue-raising measures.', 'House Republicans recently passed their own budget proposal out of committee, a plan that aims to reduce the deficit by $14 trillion over a decade. It relies on both detailed and some vague plans for spending cuts, as well as some optimistic economic assumptions.', '“We have to acknowledge that the president is transparent — detailed every way he is going to show he values the American people,” White House budget director Shalanda Young told reporters. “Congressional Republicans hid behind high-level talking points about balancing.

Weber also expressed reservations with Good’s leadership specifically, saying he had a hard time digesting Good’s decision not to initially support Donald Trump in the presidential race.', '“This just isn’t the Freedom Caucus I joined 10 years ago. By any measure, I am one of the most conservative members of Congress,” Weber told POLITICO in an exclusive statement. “Bob Good is anti-Trump and taking this group in a direction I just don’t agree with.

Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) resigned from the House Freedom Caucus board late last year after announcing his opposition to Good’s campaign for chair, though he cited a need to “move policy in the right direction” and not Good’s position on Trump.', 'Good defended his endorsement of DeSantis by arguing he wasn’t against Trump, but that he wanted a conservative president who could have eight years in office.

Here is what the Tax Foundation writes:', 'Corporate income taxes are taxes on business profits earned by C corporations. The corporate income tax directly increases the cost of making investments in capital, like machinery and equipment, which businesses and workers use to be more productive. When businesses and workers are more productive, the economy grows. So, by increasing the cost of making investments, the corporate income tax discourages investment and productivity growth, creating one of the largest negative impacts on economic growth compared to other taxes.', 'In addition, if he does get his wish and raises the corporate-income-tax rate, he won’t raise the revenue he hopes to raise, and whatever he gets could eventually be shouldered by workers in the form of lower wages. The same can be said for the rest of his capital-income-taxing agenda.', 'Another point: After ten years, the president claims he will have increased spending by $4.4 trillion on top of its fiscal year 2024 level and raised revenue by an addition $5.1 trillion annually. Don’t buy it. The document is packed with budget gimmicks and tricks to make things look better than they are.

', 'The president emphasized his support of working families and the middle class in particular, vowing that no one earning less than $400,000 a year would pay more in federal taxes. But he had some tough words for the highest echelons of the corporate world, outlining plans to raise the corporate minimum tax, increase the levy for billionaires, and crack down on loopholes for executive compensation and private jet use. ', '“Tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over, and the wealthy and biggest corporations no longer get all the tax breaks,” he said.', 'Here are some of the biggest takeaways from Biden’s State of the Union address. ', 'Biden wasn’t shy about taking aim at big corporations and wealthy Americans who he says need to pay more in taxes. In fact, he used the term “fair share” six times throughout his speech. ', 'The president cited statistics from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that 55 of the biggest companies in the U.S. in 2020 paid nothing in federal income taxes. He also touted the Inflation Reduction Act, which he signed into law in 2022, which requires a 15% minimum corporate tax rate. ', 'Biden said he wants to further increase the corporate minimum tax rate to 21%. And in a fact sheet released by the White House yesterday, his administration outlined plans to raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, and clamp down on multinational companies and “Big Pharma” in particular. ', '“The way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share,” he said in his speech. ', 'Speaking of which, Biden had no qualms in calling out the super rich and their low tax rates.  ', '“No billionaire should pay a lower federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker or a nurse,” he said. ', 'The president went on to argue for a minimum tax rate on billionaires of 25%, estimating it would generate $500 billion over the next decade. In a statement, the White House wrote that the 25% rate would also apply to people with more than $100 million in wealth. ', 'The money from those taxes could be used to fund social safety net programs, according to Biden. “Imagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable child care millions of families can get—they need to go to work to help grow the economy,” he said. ', 'CEO compensation has become a hot button issue over the past few years, with the gap between workers and top bosses becoming a major pain point for many Americans. ', 'Biden called out tax breaks for executive pay specifically in his speech: “They can pay $20 million if they want but deduct a million, end it now,” he said. ', 'In a statement, the White House specified that Biden would deny companies a tax deduction when pay was higher than $1 million for any employee. ', 'In the same breath as executive pay, Biden also said he will increase taxes on corporate jet travel. ', 'The president plans to eliminate tax breaks that favor corporate jets over commercial planes, and increase the fuel tax on private jet travel “so that corporate executives and other wealthy Americans pay their fair share for the use of airspace and other public services related to air travel,” the White House wrote in a statement.

As he often does, Biden may claim that the rich pay lower tax rates than firefighters or school teachers or that the rich pay a tax rate of just 8 percent.', 'A Reuters story on the State of the Union address parrots the White House theme without any independent fact‐checking: “The average American worker paid about a 25% tax rate in 2022, the OECD reported. White House research found the wealthiest individuals paid about 8% from 2010 to 2018.”', 'White House “research”? The 8 percent is a concoction by Biden political appointees at odds with data from the US Treasury, Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Internal Revenue Service, and Joint Committee on Taxation. All these official sources find that tax rates on high earners are much higher than tax rates on lower‐ and middle‐income folks. Let’s look at the Treasury and CBO data.', 'The first chart shows Treasury estimates for 2024 by income decile and the top 1 percent. The tax rates are all federal taxes (income, payroll, excise, and other) divided by family income. The top 1 percent will pay an average rate of 31.5 percent this year, compared with 10–12 percent in the middle and about 0 percent at the bottom. The rates near the bottom can be negative because of refundable tax credits.', '', 'The second chart shows Congressional Budget Office estimates for the low‑, middle‑, and high‐income quintiles and the top 1 percent. The tax rates are federal income, payroll, and excise taxes divided by household income.', 'The average tax rate on the top 1 percent has hovered around 30 percent for four decades.', 'Average tax rates on the low‐ and middle‐income quintiles have trended downward. Households in the low quintile pay no net federal taxes, while households in the middle quintile paid about 13 percent in recent years prior to 2020. Tax rates plunged in 2020 due to “recovery rebate credits” handed out that year, which were refundable tax credits.', 'In sum, Treasury and CBO data show that federal tax rates at the bottom average about 0 percent or less, tax rates in the middle average less than 15 percent, and rates at the top average around 30 percent. Average tax rates at the top are twice the tax rates in the middle.', '', 'False claims about tax rates on high earners are remarkably persistent given the easy availability of the official data.

Here are four key points from Biden’s speech.\n1', 'Biden praised the strength of the U.S. economy, saying it created 15 million new jobs in three years, accelerating the recovery from the 2020 pandemic.', 'In addition to touting historic growth for Black and Hispanic workers, he said the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act has helped spur more U.S. manufacturing, creating 800,000 domestic jobs. He noted that some of these jobs paid six-figure salaries and didn’t require a college degree. ', 'The Inflation Reduction Act gave Medicare the power to negotiate prices on a handful of prescription drugs. Biden said he now wants to expand that power to cover 500 drugs. ', '“Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It’s wrong and I’m ending it,” he said. ', 'Biden also proposed other caps on drug prices, including extending the $35 cap on the cost of insulin to all Americans, not just those on Medicare. He also proposed a $2,000 annual cap on prescription drug costs, extending to all Americans a program that will soon be available to seniors on Medicare. ', 'Biden also spoke about eliminating hidden “junk fees” in bills, touting new rules that capped most credit card late fees at $8, from the $32 average now charged. He said the change would save Americans $20 billion a year. ', 'Earlier Thursday, Biden proposed a new first-time homebuyer credit of $10,000, as well as a second credit of $10,000 for homebuyers who sell their starter home. During the State of the Union, he unveiled other ideas for helping move a housing market that has been struggling under limited supply and high prices. ', '“I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space,” he said. ', 'Another measure Biden said he would pursue would be to eliminate title insurance on federally backed mortgages, which he said could save homebuyers $1,000 or more in fees. ', 'Biden also said his administration had cut “red tape” for builders that helped get federal financing to build 1.7 million affordable homes. ', 'One of Biden’s priorities in the coming year is to extend tax credits that are set to expire in 2025 that he said saved taxpayers $800 a year. He said he is looking to make those credits permanent.', 'Biden also railed against the taxes paid by corporations and billionaires. ', '“Folks at home, does anybody really think the tax code is fair?” Biden asked. ""Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion in tax breaks? I sure don’t.""', ""Nobody making less than $400,000 will pay an “additional penny in federal taxes,” under Biden's plan, which would raise taxes on businesses and the ultra-wealthy, he said. Biden pointed to the minimum 15% federal tax that corporations pay, arguing that it should be raised to 21%. He also said the average federal tax rate for billionaires is 8.2%, arguing for a minimum tax of 25%."", '“No billionaire should pay a lower federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker or a nurse,” he said.', '']"

But Biden is sure to spend the next seven months drawing a contrast with the former president by repeating the message he delivered last night: “Does anybody really think the tax code is fair?

Early in his primary campaign, Trump talked about making deeper cuts in the corporate tax rate and new tariffs on imported goods, sometimes singling out China.', 'Making A Contrast', 'More recently, he has downplayed the corporate rate cut and focused instead on making the TCJA permanent. But to the degree Trump campaigns on policy at all, he is more likely to focus on immigration and crime than on taxes.   ', 'That means Biden will have to contrast his tax agenda with that of congressional Republicans as much as Trump. Still, there are some stark contrasts between the current and former presidents when it comes to taxes.   ', 'Trump favors a 15 percent corporate tax rate. Biden favors 28 percent. Biden wants the US engaged in international tax reform. Trump does not.', 'Trump wants to make all provisions of the TCJA permanent and has been silent about making up the projected revenue loss of more than $3 trillion. Biden would extend individual provisions of the TCJA only for those making $400,000 or less. And would finance that effort, at least in part.', 'Ideas Dropped', 'While Biden reprised many ideas he’s espoused in the past, he ignored some past proposals, at least this week. For example, he never mentioned taxing accrued capital gains even if investors have not sold assets. Nor did he discuss taxing capital gains on unsold assets at death, which would make it harder to avoid tax on investment profits made over a decedent’s lifetime. It is not clear whether any of these ideas will appear in his more detailed budget due next week.', 'Finally, Biden was silent on past plans to extend the solvency of Social Security, an effort that would require payroll tax increases on workers. Instead, he said what he wouldn’t do, including raising the retirement age.', 'A Political Message ', 'Some of Biden’s proposals may be more effective as a political message than as a tool to raise revenue.  ', 'For example, the current 1 percent tax on stock buybacks has had little impact on corporate stock repurchases and while 4 percent levy may discourage some buybacks, most doubt it would change behavior much. In a forthcoming analysis, TPC estimates that in the absence of any excise tax, the US tax advantage for buybacks over dividends is 7.2 percent. About two-thirds of the total US tax advantage is attributable to foreign shareholders. ', 'Similarly, capping corporate tax deductions for non-executive employee compensation is unlikely to change pay practices. For one thing, the new tax would apply only to publicly traded C corporations. But many highly paid employees, such as doctors, lawyers, financiers, and athletes are at firms with other business structures such as partnerships, S corporations, and limited liability corporations.', 'While Biden’s tax platform technically was a preview of his fiscal 2025 budget, in an election year a deeply divided Congress is unlikely to pass any of these changes. But while Biden spoke to lawmakers, they were not really his audience. 2024 voters were.

The proposal would also raise the minimum income tax for billionaires to 25%, up from what the Biden administration claims is an average tax rate of 8%, according to the administration, after tax preferences—that number is based on a hypothetical situation in which unrealized stock market gains were taxed each year, rather than only being taxed when the stock is sold.', 'Meanwhile, large corporations would pay more as well, with the corporate tax rate going up to 28%, while setting a minimum of 21% for billion-dollar companies in income taxes.', '“President Biden believes large corporations should pay their fair share and is committed to reversing the massive tax giveaway to big corporations that Republicans enacted in 2017,” the administration wrote.', ' ', 'The budget proposal stated that “The President opposes any proposal to cut benefits, as well as proposals to privatize Social Security” and proposed a 9% increase to the Social Security Administration’s operating budget so the agency can improve its customer service.', 'The Biden administration also suggested that the president might support increasing or even removing the cap on income subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes—currently $168,600—to help fund Social Security, though the proposal does not explicitly say this: “Currently, middle-class and lower-income Americans pay Social Security taxes on all of their earnings, but higher-income Americans do not. That’s not fair. The President believes that protecting Social Security should start with asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share.”', 'The budget tees up a debate about Social Security funding and administration during the presidential election in 2024. On Monday, presumptive Republican nominee Trump was asked how he would handle Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on CNBC’s Squawk Box. He responded that, “there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements—tremendous bad management of entitlements.”', 'The former president added that, when it comes to the Biden administration, “I know that they’re going to end up weakening Social Security, because the country is weak.”', 'Biden later responded on a social media post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter: “not on my watch,” in reference to the remarks about cuts to Social Security. ', 'The administration is also seeking tax increases to help fund Medicare.', 'The budget proposal would “modestly increase the Medicare tax rate on income above $400,000,” the administration wrote.', 'The plan is before Congress, but unlikely to get any movement, particularly in the Republican-controlled House, which will offer its own spending plans for 2025. Meanwhile, the government will need to work through spending needs for the current year, as a continuing resolution is set to expire on March 22.', 'Employees younger than 30 were the most likely to contribute $0 to their HSAs, according to a new Inspira study.', 'Many Generation Z employees with access to a health savings account are not using them to their full potential or are not contributing to them at all, according to new data from Inspira Financial.', 'While young professionals tend to champion mental health and investing in their physical and emotional well-being, Inspira found that nearly one-third of employees younger than 30 contribute nothing to their HSA annually (a higher figure than any other generation), and only 14% contribute more than $3,000 per year (a lower percentage than any other generation).  ', 'Inspira’s report analyzed 700,732 Inspira HSA holders from January 2023 through September 2023. ', 'Bryan Levy, Inspira’s managing director of consumer-directed business, says one factor contributing to this lack of HSA participation is that Gen Z employees are early in their careers, therefore tend to make less money than their older colleagues and may feel unable to afford contributing to an HSA. ', 'Additionally, Levy says those in Gen Z are dealing with higher medical bills relative to their peers, as well as expensive car payments, student loan repayments and perhaps even mortgage payments if they have purchased a home.  ', '“The convergence of lower income relative to peers plus higher [medical] costs relative to their peers leads to a squeezing of the water balloon, [and] there’s just less money to go around,” Levy says.  ', 'These high medical costs also come at a time when young people are experiencing “unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression and overall distress,” according to research by McKinsey & Co., which also stated that Gen Z employees are less proactive overall in seeking care than other generations. McKinsey attributed this behavior to “developmental stage, disengagement from their health care, perceived affordability and stigma associated with mental or substance abuse disorders within their families and communities.” ', 'A recent study by PYMNTS and Experian also found that Gen Z patients were the least aware that they would be required to make an out-of-pocket payment at their most recent medical appointment, with 32% not knowing they would need to make co-payments. ', 'Levy adds that he finds it surprising that Inspira’s study revealed a high percentage of Gen Z employees dealing with chronic conditions—often behavioral health conditions—despite the popular assumption that people aged 22 to 30 are “invincible.” ', '“Employers and institutions might be able to reduce future health care costs by tending to the behavioral health and physical health needs when someone is ‘invincible,’” Levy says. “By ensuring that people have reduced barriers to care, through high deductible health plans with an HSA … [an employee’s] costs when they’re older might be more controlled and affordable.” ', 'According to Inspira’s report, longer savings horizons allow key benefits of HSAs to shine, such as the triple tax advantage of these accounts (contributions go in tax-free, the money grows tax-free and it can be withdrawn tax-free).  ', 'The report also identified that education on the benefits of prioritizing savings contributions could help the youngest cohort of employees better plan for all their financial obligations. For example, if an employee’s 401(k) plan sponsor will match 50% of the first 6% of contributions and an employee plans to contribute 7%, Levy recommends allocating the extra 1% into an HSA, if one is available.  ', '“If you put that extra percent in the HSA, it actually may be a better long-term strategy because of the tax-advantaged nature of an HSA,” Levy says. “Some of the things that we’re talking about with employers is how to help Gen Z, Gen X and even [Baby] Boomers [understand] what to do with your next best dollar, because making the right decision there could be the difference between paying a penalty for taking out a 401(k) loan or paying full price for health care versus a tax-reduced cost for health care.” ', 'Besides the financial benefits of an HSA, the report noted that HSAs also move with employees if they change jobs, which could appeal to young professionals as they are more likely to switch jobs more frequently in the beginning of their careers. ', 'The report also highlighted the importance of helping employees seek preventative care to reduce unnecessary stress on the health care system going forward, as delaying care can not only exacerbate conditions that could have been treated earlier, but delayed treatment is significantly more expensive.  ', 'According to the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, medical plan costs will rise an estimated median of 7% in 2024, due to factors such as inflation and delayed routine care.
