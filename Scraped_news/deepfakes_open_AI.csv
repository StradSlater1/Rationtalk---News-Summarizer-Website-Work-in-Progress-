OpenAI Offers an Olive Branch to Artists Wary of Feeding AI Algorithms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGVuYWktb2xpdmUtYnJhbmNoLWFydGlzdHMtYWktYWxnb3JpdGhtcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['', '', 'KATE KNIBBS', 'OpenAI is fighting lawsuits from artists, writers, and publishers who allege it inappropriately used their work to train the algorithms behind ChatGPT and other AI systems. On Tuesday the company announced a tool apparently designed to appease creatives and rights holders, by granting them some control over how OpenAI uses their work.', 'The company says it will launch a tool in 2025 called Media Manager that allows content creators to opt out their work from the company’s AI development. In a blog post, OpenAI described the tool as a way to allow “creators and content owners to tell us what they own” and specify “how they want their works to be included or excluded from machine learning research and training.”', 'OpenAI said that it is working with “creators, content owners, and regulators” to develop the tool and intends it to “set an industry standard.” The company did not name any of its partners on the project or make clear exactly how the tool will operate.', 'Open questions about the system include whether content owners will be able to make a single request to cover all their works, and whether OpenAI will allow requests related to models that have already been trained and launched. Research is underway on machine “unlearning,” a process that adjusts an AI system to retrospectively remove the contribution of one part of its training data, but the technique has not yet been perfected.', ""Ed Newton-Rex, CEO of the startup Fairly Trained, which certifies AI companies that use ethically-sourced training data, says OpenAI’s apparent shift on training data is welcome but that the implementation will be critical. “I'm glad to see OpenAI engaging with this issue. Whether or not it will actually help artists will come down to the detail, which hasn't been provided yet,” he says. The first major question on his mind: Is this simply an opt-out tool that leaves OpenAI contining to use data without permission unless a content owner requests its exclusion? Or will it represent a larger shift in how OpenAI does business? OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment."", 'Newton-Rex is also curious to know if OpenAI will allow other companies to use its Media Manager so that artists can signal their preferences to multiple AI developers at once. “If not, it will just add further complexity to an already complex opt-out environment,” says Newton-Rex, who was formerly an executive at Stability AI, developer of the Stable Diffusion image generator.', 'OpenAI is not the first to look for ways for artists and other content creators to signal their preferences about use of their work and personal data for AI projects. Other tech companies, from Adobe to Tumblr, also offer opt-out tools regarding data collection and machine learning. The startup Spawning launched a registry called Do Not Train nearly two years ago and creators have already added their preferences for 1.5 billion works.', ""Jordan Meyer, CEO of Spawning, says the company is not working with OpenAI on its Media Manager project, but is open to doing so. “If OpenAI is able to make registering or respecting universal opt-outs easier, we'll happily incorporate their work into our suite,” he says."", 'FEATURED VIDEO', 'How This Artist Uses A.I. & Data to Teach Us About the World', ""KATE O'FLAHERTY"", 'MATT SIMON', 'ALISTAIR CHARLTON', 'DAN GEARINO', 'Like Newton-Rex, though, Meyer worries that the creation of many different opt-in systems will be too onerous for artists and creators. “A proliferation of disparate opt-out tools built by AI giants is exactly what we need to avoid,” he says. “Opting out should be simple and universal, which we believe requires an open system built by a third party.”', 'Past attempts by major AI developers to provide people more control over how their data is used haven’t always run smoothly. Last year, Meta launched a way for people who didn’t want their personal data used to train Meta’s AI to request it be deleted. Many artists interpreted this as way to ask for their work to be opted-out of Meta’s AI projects, and were frustrated when the company declined to process their requests. (Meta, for its part, told WIRED that it was not an opt-out feature.)', ""Meanwhile, a rising movement that objects to AI’s approach to training data is advocating for a far more radical change: Switching to a regime where AI companies only train algorithms on data with explicit permission from creative and rights holders. “When it comes to companies that are looking to turn massive profits and to disrupt industries, I don't think opt-out works at all,” says concept artist and illustrator Reid Southen, who often writes about AI and art. “Opt-in is the only feasible way forward.”"", 'Southen and Newton-Rex both say that opt-out tools can put an undue burden on creatives, especially if these tools require them to submit requests for each individual work they want to exclude from training. “Imagine if you’re a photographer with thousands and thousands of images,” Southern says. “There’s no way.”', 'Navigate election season with our WIRED Politics Lab newsletter and podcast', 'A hacker took down North Korea’s internet.

The other, a sleek modern mansion in San Francisco’s Twin Peaks neighborhood, was started by former Google Brain researcher Jeremy Nixon. Their patrons include a trick-or-treat bag of tech personalities — billionaire Google cofounder Sergey Brin, musician and AI evangelist Grimes and some of Sand Hill Road’s most coveted investors. But in dueling trademark applications, the estranged proprietors of the first house both claim ownership of the AGI House brand, telling Forbes they’re willing to go to court for it.', 'The balkanization of AGI House was the culmination of tensions that had been escalating since Yu moved into the Hillsborough property in December 2022. Nixon claims he brought Yu on in an operational role; Yu said he always believed he’d be taking over the house and that Nixon’s claims to it have been dramatically overstated. “He’s trying to say he did a lot of work and contributed a lot of things, but among the nine residents in the house, probably he did the least,” Yu told Forbes. “I wouldn’t say bad things about him, but he was definitely not a top performer in the house.”', 'Nixon called Yu’s position “farcical” and “deeply disrespectful.” “Had I not existed, what would’ve happened in the world?” he said. “The shadow of my influence stands over everything that is done in the Hillsborough house. If Rocky never existed, AGI House would still exist. He should thank me for creating everything that he currently is standing on top of.”', 'So now there are two AGI Houses, in two very different locales, with two competing visions. Nixon dreams of an “intellectual community” without a formalized business structure, a nod to an earlier time of communes and revolutionary salons. But in Yu’s eyes, the community is a business. He wants to platform and invest in the AI startups that emerge from it. He established AGI House Ventures, and said he’s already secured half of the capital he needs from limited partners like Android creator Rich Miner.

Most recently, eight prominent U.S. newspapers including the Chicago Tribune sued OpenAI for IP infringement relating to the company’s use of generative AI, accusing OpenAI of pilfering articles for training generative AI models that it then commercialized without compensating — or crediting — the source publications.', 'Generative AI models including OpenAI’s — the sorts of models that can analyze and generate text, images, videos and more — are trained on an enormous number of examples usually sourced from public sites and data sets. OpenAI and other generative AI vendors argue that fair use, the legal doctrine that allows for the use of copyrighted works to make a secondary creation as long as it’s transformative, shields their practice of scraping public data and using it for model training. But not everyone agrees.', 'OpenAI, in fact, recently argued that it would be impossible to create useful AI models absent copyrighted material.', 'But in an effort to placate critics and defend itself against future lawsuits, OpenAI has taken steps to meet content creators in the middle.', 'OpenAI last year allowed artists to “opt out” of and remove their work from the data sets that the company uses to train its image-generating models. The company also lets website owners indicate via the robots.txt standard, which gives instructions about websites to web-crawling bots, whether content on their site can be scraped to train AI models. And OpenAI continues to ink licensing deals with large content owners, including news organizations, stock media libraries and Q&A sites like Stack Overflow.', 'Some content creators say OpenAI hasn’t gone far enough, however.', 'Artists have described OpenAI’s opt-out workflow for images, which requires submitting an individual copy of each image to be removed along with a description, as onerous. OpenAI reportedly pays relatively little to license content. And, as OpenAI itself acknowledges in the blog post Tuesday, the company’s current solutions don’t address scenarios in which creators’ works are quoted, remixed or reposted on platforms they don’t control.', 'Beyond OpenAI, a number of third parties are attempting to build universal provenance and opt-out tools for generative AI.', 'Startup Spawning AI, whose partners include Stability AI and Hugging Face, offers an app that identifies and tracks bots’ IP addresses to block scraping attempts, as well as a database where artists can register their works to disallow training by vendors who choose to respect the requests. Steg.AI and Imatag help creators establish ownership of their images by applying watermarks imperceptible to the human eye.

Our goal is to have the tool in place by 2025, and we hope it will set a standard across the AI industry.“', 'No price has yet been listed for the tool, and I’m guessing it will be offered for free since OpenAI is using it to position itself as an ethical actor.', 'The tool seeks to offer creators additional protections for AI data scraping beyond adding a string of code to the robots.txt file on their websites (“User-agent: GPTBot Disallow: /”), a measure that OpenAI introduced back in August 2023.', 'After all, many creators post work on sites that they don’t own or control — platforms such as DeviantArt or Pateron — where they would not be able to edit the robots.txt file on their pages. In addition, some creators may wish to exempt only certain works — not all of the things they post — from AI data scraping and training, so the Media Manager proposed by OpenAI would allow for this type of more granular control and optionality.', 'In addition, OpenAI notes that creators’ work can be readily screenshotted, saved, reshared, and otherwise reposted or redistributed across the web on domains that don’t offer the opt-out text.', '“We understand these are incomplete solutions, as many creators do not control websites where their content may appear, and content is often quoted, reviewed, remixed, reposted and used as inspiration across multiple domains. We need an efficient, scalable solution for content owners to express their preferences about the use of their content in AI systems.”', 'The moves come amid an ongoing wave of visual artists and creators objecting to AI model makers such as OpenAI and its rivals Anthropic, Meta, Cohere and others scraping the web for data to train on without their express permission, consent, or compensation.', 'Several creators have filed class action lawsuits against OpenAI and other AI companies alleging this practice of data scraping violates the copyright of the creators’ images and works.', 'OpenAI’s defense is that web crawling and scraping has been an accepted and standard practice among many companies across the web for decades now, and it alludes to this argument again in today’s blog post, writing: “Decades ago, the robots.txt standard was introduced and voluntarily adopted by the Internet ecosystem for web publishers to indicate what portions of websites web crawlers could access.”', 'Indeed, many artists tacitly accepted the scraping of their data for indexing in search engines such as Google, yet object to generative AI training on it, because it competes more directly with their own work product and livelihoods.', 'OpenAI offers indemnification — guarantees of legal assistance and defense — for subscribers to its paid plans accused of copyright infringement, a bid to reassure its growing list of lucrative enterprise customers.', 'The courts have yet to rule decisively on whether AI companies and others can scrape copyrighted creative works without express consent or permission of the creators. But clearly, regardless of how it is settled legally, OpenAI wants to position itself as a cooperative and ethical entity with regards to creators and its data sources.', 'That said, creators are likely to view this move as “too little, too late” since many of their works have already presumably been scraped and used to train AI models, and OpenAI is nowhere suggesting it could or would remove the portions of its models trained on such works.', 'In its blog post, OpenAI makes the argument that it does not preserve copies of scraped data wholesale, only “an equation that best describes the relationship among the words and the underlying process that produced them.”', 'As the company writes:', '“We design our AI models to be learning machines, not databases', 'Our models are designed to help us generate new content and ideas – not to repeat or “regurgitate” content. AI models can state facts, which are in the public domain. If on rare occasions a model inadvertently repeats expressive content, it is a failure of the machine learning process. This failure is more likely to occur with content that appears frequently in training datasets, such as content that appears on many different public websites due to being frequently quoted. We employ state-of-the-art techniques throughout training and at output, for our API or ChatGPT, to prevent repetition, and we’re continually making improvements with on-going research and development.“', 'At the very least, the Media Manager tool may be a more efficient and user friendly way to block AI training than other existing options such as Glaze and Nightshade, though if it is coming from OpenAI, it is not clear yet whether creators will even trust it — nor whether it will be able to block training by other rival models.', '', 'Stay in the know!
