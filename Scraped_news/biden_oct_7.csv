The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.', '“We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone,” Biden said.', 'But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential political problems that the president is facing with the younger voters he needs to win a second term.', 'On Tuesday, during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw direct links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack.', '“This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.', 'He continued, “Now, here we are – not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later – and people are already forgetting. They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. … I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.”', 'Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.', '“Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice.', 'The president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans “can’t stand by and stand silent.” Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.', 'The most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a “dramatic” increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are “more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.”', 'Biden offered a direct message to American Jews Tuesday.', '“I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. Let me reassure you as your president: You are not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,” he said.', 'He recounted the story of Tom Lantos, who escaped a Nazi labor camp during the Holocaust with the help of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who used his diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews. Lantos became a top adviser to Biden, then a first-term senator, and later became the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress.', 'The president quoted Lantos, who warned, “The veneer of civilization is paper-thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.”', '“My fellow Americans: We must be the guardians,” Biden added.', 'While the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza.', 'The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel’s war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.', 'The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.', 'During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.', 'Biden on Tuesday reiterated his “ironclad” commitment to Israel’s right to exist as an independent Jewish state – “even when we disagree.”', 'Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.', 'The speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation’s colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18. ', 'On Tuesday, Biden reaffirmed the right to free speech, but roundly condemned antisemitism, hate speech and threats of violence “against Jews or anyone else.”', 'Biden’s speech on the topic last week appeared to mark a shift in the administration’s response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning “abhorrent” incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources – a move aimed at further bolstering the administration’s public-facing response to the protests.', 'He cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should “go back to Poland,” verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.', 'House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking earlier at the same event as Biden on Tuesday, compared the growing unrest at college campuses to German “elite centers of learning” in the 1930s and 40s “where anti-Jewish courses were introduced” and saying “today we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.”', '“The very campuses which were once the envy of the International Academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus. Students who were known for producing academic papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research are now linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters and calling for global intifada,” Johnson said.', 'On Monday, a day ahead of Biden’s speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.', 'Tuesday’s speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.', 'The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.', 'The Department of Homeland Security is working to “build an online campus safety resource guide” to provide “financial, educational, and technical assistance” for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing “best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,” the fact sheet said.', 'And the State Department’s Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism “will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,” the fact sheet said.', 'Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.', 'Still, Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.', 'Biden’s remarks linking the Holocaust and the October 7 attack were largely praised by pro-Israel groups.', 'Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street – a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group – said in a statement he is grateful to Biden “for standing unequivocally against the sharp rise in antisemitism while also defending our First Amendment rights to speech and nonviolent protest.”', 'Adam Lehman, the president and CEO of Hillel International, a Jewish campus group, said in a statement Biden’s remarks “come at an important moment, as anti-Israel and anti-Jewish groups continue to pursue hateful, divisive and destructive actions that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and undermine campus safety for all students.”', 'However, leaders of two of the largest US Jewish groups that have been critical of Israel’s actions in its war with Hamas said Biden had missed the mark in his description of college protests.', 'Stefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said Biden’s characterization of campus protests was “entirely inaccurate” and “a really intentional misrepresentation.” She said that “peaceful multiracial, multifaith student protesters are simply calling out the very clear complicity of their universities in the Israeli attack on Palestinians.”', 'Eva Borgwardt, a national spokesperson for IfNotNow, said Biden’s speech “was a misclassification of what’s happening on college campuses.”', '“To respond to a few isolated incidents in what has been overwhelmingly nonviolent student protest with the use of police and state force that targets particularly Palestinian, black and brown students, Jewish students among them, is a completely irresponsible and dangerous approach to protest and does not at all advance any kind of Jewish safety,” Borgwardt said.', 'CNN’s Eric Bradner, Nicole Goodkind, Kristin Wilson, Dana Bash and MJ Lee contributed to this report.', 'This story has been updated with additional reporting.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Hatred towards Jews didn’t end with the Holocaust, he said – it was “brought to life on October 7 2023” when Hamas unleashed its attack on Israel killing 1,200 people.', '“Now here we are not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror … I have not forgotten, and we will not forget.”', 'Biden’s forceful evocation of the shadows of the Holocaust and the scourge of antisemitism was made at a volatile moment when Israel’s retaliatory military operation in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and brought 2.3 million people to the edge of starvation. Demonstrations against the war and calls for a ceasefire has led to turmoil at scores of US universities and colleges – and opened fissures within Biden’s Democratic party that could imperil his re-election hopes in November.', 'The president, who has generally avoided commenting on the campus protests since they erupted at Columbia University in New York three weeks earlier, acknowledged that his remembrance speech fell “on difficult times”. He also said that he understood that “people have strong beliefs and deep convictions”, adding that the US respected free speech.', 'But he went on to decry antisemitic posters and “slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel” on college campuses. “Jewish students [have been] blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class,” Biden said.', 'He concluded that there is “no place on any campus in America or any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.', '“Violent attacks destroying property is not peaceful protest – it’s against the law,” he said.', 'Student protesters strongly pushed back at the implication that hatred motivated the pro-Palestinian encampments. A group of more than 750 Jewish students from 140 campuses issued a joint letter on Tuesday calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and rejecting Biden’s equation of the protests with antisemitism.', '“As Jewish students, we wholeheartedly reject the claim that these encampments are antisemitic and that they are an inherent threat to Jewish student safety,” the letter said.', 'Hours before the president delivered his speech, police in riot gear cleared a protest encampment at the University of Chicago. The action began at about 4.30am in the Quad where hundreds of students had been living in tents for more than a week.', 'Sign up to First Thing', 'Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters', '', 'The encampment was completely dismantled within about three hours, but about 400 protesters later reassembled outside the university’s administrative building. They chanted “Free, free, Palestine”, and they staged a standoff with police.', 'In a statement, the university’s president, Paul Alivisatos, said that protesters had been given a chance to voluntarily dismantle the encampment, and he stressed there had been no arrests. But he said negotiations with encampment representatives had broken down because of the “intractable and inflexible aspects of their demands”.', 'At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, protesters regained access to the encampment there after police had removed them and erected fencing around the area on Monday. Dozens of protesters remained at the site, the Associated Press reported, as they continued to press demands that MIT breaks its research ties to the Israeli military.', 'Tensions are rising on campuses as institutions approach their traditional graduation ceremonies, with many school governments attempting to clear the encampments to make way for the celebrations. On Monday, Columbia University announced that it was cancelling its campus-wide commencement ceremony, following the example of the University of Southern California.', 'At Harvard university, the interim president Alan Garber threatened those participating in the pro-Palestinian encampment with “involuntary leave”.

But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump’s criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism.

He and his team were successful in their long, quiet efforts to convince House Speaker Mike Johnson to protect America’s leadership abroad and defend Ukraine.

Trump is running to restore order, and voters have given him a lead.', 'Last week Biden spoke out on the campus protests, and he said the right things. He disavowed destroying property, vandalism, breaking windows, trespassing, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations, threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear, and hate speech.

This is why it’s critical that he speak more vigorously, and more often, about the protests. Biden is not managing the war against Hamas, but he owns disorder at home. The campus protests will likely thin out now that the school year has ended, but protesters are coming for the Democratic convention in August. Biden needs to address the question of disorder repeatedly so that every last voter knows what he thinks. And no matter how much pressure he gets from progressives, he must not visit any protests.', 'THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS, Biden has also refused to mitigate what may prove to be the worst threat to his re-election.

But as protests escalated last week, the president decided he needed to offer a specific condemnation of violence and property destruction before the public.', 'President Joe Biden arrives to deliver remarks on antisemitism during a Holocaust remembrance ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, on May 7, 2024. | Francis Chung/POLITICO', 'On Tuesday, he delivered a loftier speech, though one that similarly placed him as a critic of the campus protests.', '“Whether against Jews or anyone else — violent attacks, destroying property, is not peaceful protest. It’s against the law,” he said, the crowd listening attentively as he spoke. “We’re not a lawless country. We’re a civil society. We uphold the rule of law.”', 'The address provided a striking illustration of the political terrain that the White House has had to navigate on this and other issues. As Biden spoke, his likely general election opponent — former President Donald Trump — was in a courthouse in Manhattan facing testimony from porn star Stormy Daniels about alleged efforts to cover up their alleged affair.', 'Biden aides and Democratic allies welcomed the split screen, even with the potential that it could blot out coverage of the president’s speech.', '“The more the president talks about this, the better,” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.). “With all the antisemitism going on, you can be silent, you can ignore it, but that’s not going to erase the fact that it’s growing in this country.”', 'Moskowitz and other Jewish Democrats in Congress praised Biden in the speech’s aftermath for taking a clear position against antisemitism, arguing that the administration has sought ways to ensure students’ safety on campus without taking hardline approaches aimed at quelling the right to protest peacefully.', 'But the campus unrest has been tricky for the White House to handle. Biden has faced unrelenting criticism from young voters and other blocs of the Democratic Party for his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. And he has struggled to strike a balance in demonstrating his continued support for Israel while also trying to reel in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war in Gaza, where more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed.', 'Republicans have depicted the country as mired in chaos while Trump has accused Biden of not doing enough to combat antisemitism, a criticism that ignores the former president’s past invocation of antisemitic tropes.', 'Amid reports of antisemitic episodes and harassment of Jewish students, Jewish groups have urged the administration to take a more active role in creating safer climates on campuses.', '“We’ve been looking for and will continue to press for even more aggressive action,” said Adam Lehman, the CEO of Hillel International. “It’s critical that the White House show leadership in recognizing the deep scope and nature of issues impacting our campuses — and that the president speak out about the bias, discrimination and hostility Jewish and other students are facing as a result.”', 'Biden officials across the administration have kept in close touch with Jewish groups since Hamas’ attack on Israel in October, sharing updates on its efforts at home and abroad. The administration has leaned on a number of senior officials to focus on outreach. That group includes second gentleman Doug Emhoff, the government’s highest-ranking Jewish official, and Deborah Lipstadt, who serves as Biden’s envoy for monitoring and combating antisemitism.', 'But while Jewish leaders praised the administration’s communication with the broader community, they have pushed for greater action in recent weeks to quell the campus protests. That’s included pressing the Education Department to step up civil rights investigations into antisemitism at universities, as well as calling for Biden to take a more active role in personally defining the administration’s attitude toward the protests.', '“It seems like our governmental leadership and leadership in higher education are all just trying to tread water when it comes to addressing these issues,” said Lehman, who added that while Biden has struck the right tone of late condemning violent protests and antisemitism, “I would’ve appreciated seeing that articulation earlier during this wave of issues.”', 'Within the White House, though, officials have sought to balance their strident defense of the Jewish community with acknowledgments of the crisis in Gaza that’s generated fury among Muslim and Arab American voters and progressives who fault Biden for continuing to back Israel’s offensive. In meetings with Muslim and Arab American leaders, officials have stressed that all their efforts are aimed at securing ceasefire agreement and ramping up humanitarian aid. But those conversations have become less frequent, participants said, as the conflict drags on and the administration offers no hint of changing its approach toward the Middle East.', 'Hours after Biden’s speech concluded, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if he would deliver similar remarks about the plight of Palestinians or Islamophobia. She did not commit to any upcoming address.', '“You’ve heard the president address the war and address the suffering that we’re seeing in Gaza,” she replied. “The president has spoken about what’s happening in Gaza, has spoken about what we’re seeing there, the dire humanitarian situation… The loss of civilian lives is unacceptable.”', '', 'The unofficial guide to official Washington, every morning and weekday afternoons.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By signing up, you acknowledge and agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

As he did last week in a special statement, he said he would uphold free speech but drew the line at violence and hate speech.', '“There’s no place on any campus in America, any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind,” he said.', 'Other speakers included House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican; Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, and Abe Foxman, a Holocaust survivor and the former national director off the Anti-Defamation League.', 'Johnson has been leading efforts by Republicans to tie the campus protests to the Biden administration, as well as link them to right-wing accusations of a liberal drift in academia. In his remarks, he compared the campus pro-Palestinian protests to the assault on Jewish students and academics before and during the Holocaust.', '“We remember what happened then, and today, we are witnessing American universities quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty,” said Johnson.', 'Biden’s speech comes a year after his administration launched a strategy to combat antisemitism. The White House before the speech listed new measures under the strategy that it would launch in coming days, including a letter from the Department of Education to schools and universities around the country outlining how expressions of antisemitism could spark investigations. Dozens of campuses have been investigated since Oct. 7.', 'Also listed were a planned guide for campus safety resources, and the development of best practices to prevent violence, both spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security.', 'The State Department’s office of the special envoy to combat antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt, would convene tech companies to discuss how best to deal with online antisemitic content, the White House said in its release.', 'I accept the JTA Privacy Policy.', 'By submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org']"

Biden to call for a fight against antisemitism at a precarious moment in Israel’s war in Gaza and amid protests on campus,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9iaWRlbi10by1jYWxsLWZvci1hLWZpZ2h0LWFnYWluc3QtYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLWF0LWEtcHJlY2FyaW91cy1tb21lbnQtaW4taXNyYWVsLXMtd2FyLWluLWdhemEtYW5kLWFtaWQtcHJvdGVzdHMtb24tY2FtcHVzLzIxNDE3OTMxL9IBImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL2FtcC8yMTQxNzkzMS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['Washington (CNN) — President Joe Biden on Tuesday issued a call to fight a swiftly rising tide of antisemitism, saying such hate has no place in America as he connected the horrors of the Holocaust to Hamas’ attack on Israel.', 'Biden’s speech was a somber moment of reflection amid a tense and pivotal time in his reelection push. The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.', 'But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential problems that the president is facing with younger voters that he needs to win a second term.', 'On Tuesday during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack.', '“This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.', 'He continued, “Now, here we are – not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later – and people are already forgetting. They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. … I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.”', 'Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.', '“Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice.', 'Tuesday’s remarks amount to a continuation of the White House’s strong condemnation of antisemitism throughout the conflict – but take place in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and increasingly vocal protesters at home as Biden is trying to keep a splintering 2024 coalition intact.', 'The president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans “can’t stand by and stand silent.” Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.', 'The most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a “dramatic” increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are “more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.”', '“We are in a moment of crisis for the Jewish community. With antisemitism already at historic levels and Jewish students facing a tsunami of hate on campuses across the country, there’s no more important time for a full-throated condemnation of antisemitism in all forms,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said in a statement.', 'A sensitive spot for the president', 'While the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel’s war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.', 'The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.', 'During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.', 'Concurrently, Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.', 'The speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation’s colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18. ', 'The president made his most substantive comments on the matter last Thursday, saying he supports the right to protest and freedom of speech but “order must prevail.”', '“Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduation – none of this is a peaceful protest,” Biden said. “Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It’s against the law.”', 'Asked by a reporter whether the sentiment on campus has caused him to shift his thinking on the conflict, Biden offered an emphatic, “No.”', 'A shift in tone', 'The remarks appeared to mark a shift in the administration’s response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning “abhorrent” incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources – a move aimed at further bolstering the administration’s public-facing response to the protests.', 'He cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should “go back to Poland,” verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.', 'And on Monday, a day ahead of Biden’s speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.', 'Tuesday’s speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.', 'The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.', 'The Department of Homeland Security is working to “build an online campus safety resource guide” to provide “financial, educational, and technical assistance” for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing “best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,” the fact sheet said.', 'And the State Department’s Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism “will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,” the fact sheet said.', 'Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.', 'Still, Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.', 'CNN’s Dana Bash contributed to this report.', 'This story has been updated with additional reporting.', 'The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
