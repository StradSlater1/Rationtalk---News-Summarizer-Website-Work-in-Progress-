The pledged support is not binding until the delegates cast their votes, which party officials said would take place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7.', 'With barely more than 100 days until the election, Ms. Harris immediately pressed her case against former President Donald J. Trump during a visit to her new campaign headquarters, invoking her early career as a prosecutor who took on “predators” and “fraudsters.”', '“Hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said to cheers.', 'The vice president compared her day-old campaign to the civil rights and voting rights battles of the past, placing it on a continuum with “abolitionists and suffragettes.” And she said that Mr. Trump’s potential return would undo some of those victories and take the country backward.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '“We are not going back,” she said.', 'Behind the scenes, Ms. Harris was moving just as quickly to take control of a sprawling political apparatus that just a day earlier had belonged to President Biden.', 'Ms. Harris tapped former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who once oversaw Barack Obama’s vice-presidential vetting, to oversee her choice of a potential running mate, according to two people briefed on the matter.', 'Two of Ms. Harris’s top political advisers, Sheila Nix and Brian Fallon, joined the Monday morning call of senior staff members on the Biden-turned-Harris campaign — a sign of her team’s widening footprint inside the operation.', 'Later in Wilmington, Del., Ms. Harris herself told the assembled staff members that she had asked the current campaign leadership, including the chair, Jen O’Malley Dillon, to stay on and that Ms. O’Malley Dillon had accepted.', '“We are one team, one fight,” Ms. Harris said.', 'Across Washington and beyond, there was widespread talk of whom Ms. Harris might bring in to supplement the current team. A former campaign manager for Mr. Obama, David Plouffe, fueled rumors when he appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and expressed openness to joining the campaign.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '“All of us who want to see Kamala Harris elected president and Donald Trump not elected to the White House will do whatever we need to,” said Mr. Plouffe, who did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Ms. Harris’s most immediate task had been to secure the support of enough Democratic delegates to lock down the nomination. A Google form asking delegates to endorse her had circulated among those key Democrats, who include party officials, lawmakers, local activists and volunteers.', 'The next step in the party’s formal nomination of Ms. Harris will come on Wednesday, when the rules committee of the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to meet to set a date for a virtual roll-call vote of the state delegations. On a call with reporters on Monday night, Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the party’s presidential nominee would be selected by Aug. 7 to avoid legal risks from ballot deadlines.', '“We will deliver a presidential nominee by Aug. 7 of this year,” Mr. Harrison said.', 'The party’s convention is set to begin on Aug. 19 in Chicago.', 'Senator Laphonza Butler of California, a key Harris ally who spoke to the vice president on Sunday, said the vice president’s first goal had been “securing the delegates that are necessary and making sure the team is solid.”', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '“She takes nothing for granted,” Ms. Butler said. “She is going to do the work and she is committed to winning.”', 'Ms. Harris spent more than 10 hours on Sunday working the phones, dialing more than 100 party leaders, according to a person briefed on her activity.

Mr. West also spent the weekend with Ms. Harris.', 'One of the leaders Ms. Harris spoke to on Sunday was the Rev. Al Sharpton, the influential civil rights figure.', 'Our politics reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. That includes participating in rallies and donating money to a candidate or cause.', '“She said, ‘Now I’m going to pick up the baton and go forward and save the legacy of what we are all doing,’” he recalled her telling him.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Mr. Sharpton, who has crossed Mr. Trump for decades in the cutthroat world of New York politics, said he warned Ms. Harris: “You cannot get ready for a prize fight. This is a street fight.”', '“‘I’m prepared for that,’” he said she replied.', 'Any momentum toward a competitive nominating contest appeared to melt away early Monday when a half-dozen Democratic governors quickly fell into line behind Ms. Harris — among them Andy Beshear of Kentucky, JB Pritzker of Illinois, Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.', 'They were soon followed by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi.', 'What had been the Biden re-election website was taken offline, replaced for now by a donation portal for Ms. Harris as a new Harris for President logo was unveiled.', 'Democrats were delighted by the jolt of energy, with donors flocking to give after Mr. Biden’s exit: The Harris campaign announced on Monday that it had raised $81 million in her first 24 hours, a record sum, from 888,000 unique contributors.', 'It wasn’t just small donors, either. The leading pro-Biden super PAC, Future Forward, which has become a pro-Harris operation, said that it had unlocked $150 million in the last day with $60 million in new pledges, plus $90 million that had previously been frozen while Mr. Biden’s fate hung in the balance.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'On Monday, more than 300 past donors to Ms. Harris gathered to discuss how to support her. Among those who spoke was Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California, a longtime Harris backer.', '“People are aware it is going to be a battle every day,” Ms. Kounalakis said in a brief interview, “and we are going to be on battlefield every day.”', 'In a positive sign for her campaign, Ms. Harris appears likely to be publicly embraced by some allies who had shied away from Mr. Biden as he grew more politically toxic.', 'Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin is set to appear with Ms. Harris at her scheduled rally on Tuesday in Milwaukee, according to Andrew Mamo, a spokesman for Ms. Baldwin. When Mr. Biden held a rally in Madison two weeks ago, Ms. Baldwin held her own event in a different corner of the state 170 miles away.', 'For his part, Mr. Trump appeared to be somewhat frustrated as he watched news coverage of Democrats lining up behind Ms. Harris. He complained on his social media site that Mr. Biden was being cast as “heroic because he quit!” and that Ms. Harris was “totally failed and insignificant.”', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'The quick consolidation behind Ms. Harris actually mirrored how the party had first united behind Mr. Biden in 2020 after he won the South Carolina primary election. Then, Mr. Biden went from a candidate struggling for survival to the presumptive nominee within days.', 'In Washington, the political chatter about whom Ms. Harris might select as her running mate accelerated with the news that she had tapped Mr. Holder to vet her options. He will lead a team from his law firm, Covington & Burling, which will conduct the research.', 'Running-mate speculation swirled after Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, shared two posts on X that appeared to promote Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, as a possible choice.', 'Ms. Chavez Rodriguez later deleted the posts. A Harris campaign official said they were made in error.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Meanwhile, the field of potential vice-presidential picks began to take shape. Ms. Whitmer told a TV reporter in Michigan that she would not entertain joining the ticket. Mr. Beshear appeared on “Morning Joe,” a TV show favored by Mr. Biden and many in his orbit. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was due for a round of cable TV interviews on Monday night and Tuesday morning, during which he planned to explain the party’s nominating process and promote his own political biography.', 'Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado said in an interview on CNN that he did not expect a call.', '“Look, if they — if they do the polling and it turns out that they need a 49-year-old, balding, gay Jew from Boulder, Colo., they got my number,” he joked.', 'Still, the challenge of finding a suitable and complementary partner was real. Mr. Biden had long performed most strongly in the northern, heavily white battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.', 'It was not yet clear if or how Ms. Harris would shake up the Electoral College map, as a barrier-breaking candidate — she would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president — who could mobilize more diverse communities across the Sun Belt in Nevada, Arizona and Georgia.', 'Mr. Biden has not been seen in public since he tested positive for Covid last week and returned to his home in Delaware to isolate and recuperate. But on Monday, he dialed into Ms. Harris’s event at what had just been his campaign headquarters, appearing as a disembodied voice to urge her on.', '“I am watching you, kid!” Mr. Biden, 81, said to Ms. Harris, 59. “I love ya!”', 'Nicholas Nehamas contributed reporting.', 'Shane Goldmacher is a national political correspondent, covering the 2024 campaign and the major developments, trends and forces shaping American politics.

They may contain errors.', 'Amna Nawaz:', ""To discuss the future of the presidential race now, I'm joined by our Politics Monday team. That is Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR, who joins us from Rehoboth Beach with the pool of reporters covering President Biden."", 'Great to see you both.', ""So, Amy, you saw there Laura reported earlier on just the deluge of support from Democratic lawmakers lining up behind Vice President Harris. And a lot of the names who'd been previously floated as potential challengers, Governor Gavin Newsom of California, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have all endorsed her now."", 'Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:', 'Yes.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Why do you think the party coalesced around her so quickly?', 'Amy Walter:', ""I think they realized that it was getting late very quickly. It's not Yogi Berra, it's getting late early, and that there's only three weeks until the convention. We only have four months until Election Day, and that they had spent three weeks basically wringing their hands after the June 27 debate about what to do about Joe Biden, watching their poll numbers really sink very deeply and downballot candidates really starting to get incredibly nervous about the impact of the top of the ticket on their own races."", 'So I think what they saw was that they needed to line up immediately behind a different candidate and put all their effort into making that work.', 'Amna Nawaz:', ""And, Tam, we have seen, she's hit the ground running. Vice President Harris visited the campaign headquarters earlier today, addressed the staff. That is now her team."", 'And she delivered this message about how she plans to take a powerful message directly to former President Trump. Take a listen.', ""Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate: Predators who abused women,fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type."", 'Amna Nawaz:', ""Tam, there is the taking on Donald Trump part of this, and there's also the potentially shoring up parts of the voting blocs where President Biden had been weak. What's the Harris strategy there? Can she do that?"", 'Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:', 'Already, young voters are more excited than they were before. She is a very memeable candidate, and her videos are all over TikTok, and young people are excited.', ""You're seeing — and I will be honest, I can't fully explain it, but you are seeing coconut emojis all over the place because of something she said a year ago that has become a meme."", 'So she is bringing new life to this campaign for Democrats. As we have talked about many times before, and even before that very bad debate that President Biden had, Democrats had an unease with him. There were worries that he was too old. Democrats told pollsters. They said it in focus groups. They said that they hoped that the party would have another candidate.', ""I don't think many people imagined that it would happen exactly this way, but this is what has happened. President Biden had said he is a big believer in fate. Fate intervened with that debate, and then the three weeks of just growing concern and anxiety among Democrats."", ""And you saw it with the fund-raising; $81 million in the first 24 hours, that is record-breaking fund-raising coming from small-dollar donors. These are people — 60 percent of them were new, according to the campaign. These were people who had been holding back, who weren't excited, and there was some sort of a pent-up demand among Democrats to show that excitement."", ""She's also certainly reaching out to African American voters, the Divine Nine Black sororities and fraternities. There is a well of energy that exists for Harris and who she is and the history she could make. Of course, Republicans also want to tap into that and paint her as extreme."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'So, Amy, from what we know about why voters had been backing away from the Biden/Harris campaign in the last several months, the donor support is one thing, party officials and lawmakers lining up behind her is another.', 'Does all of that translate to the polls? Do we know?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Well, that is a question.', 'And so just to get a little bit wonky for one second, but — I think we have to be careful not to look at polls taken before Sunday as indicative of where Kamala Harris is in terms of her matchup with Donald Trump or even how people feel about her.', 'Now, they may have answered polls in which they said, when asked, what do you think about Kamala Harris being the president or running up against…', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'These are hypothetical matchups, right?', 'Amy Walter:', ""But they're hypothetical. In the same way that I could ask you about something theoretical about like a meal you're going to have, but until you actually have it, you can't really tell me what the experience was."", ""So I think it's going to be an interesting few weeks as people start to digest this. And you're right. I think, at minimum, what it does, though, it does energize both the donor base and voter base that has been sort of depressed, for lack of a better term. So what this does is, it helps to raise her floor, in other words."", ""Like, if she gets the base back, that's really good news if you are the Harris campaign. The challenge is going to be getting those swing voters onto her side. And that — we don't know yet how they are going to react either to her, the way she came into this position, and the fact, remember, she brings — she does bring some energy to the Democratic base, but she carries all the same baggage because, as we will hear from Republicans, she was principally sourced to work on the border."", ""She is in the White House when a whole bunch of other stuff passed, including the Inflation Reduction Act and others that they are no doubt going to remind voters that she can't separate herself from the actions of the administration as a whole."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Well, Tam, to that point, we have already seen Republicans working very hard to link her to President Biden, to what they call his failed policies.', ""And if you look at the Republican play, naming J.D. Vance to the ticket was really a doubling down on the base, right? And it's a straight play for that blue wall, those four states he kept mentioning over and over again of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio at the Republican National Convention."", 'In the world of potential running mates for a possible Vice — a possible President Harris nomination here, nominee here, where do Dems have the most potential advantage? Who could help her out most, if needed, against these Republican — this Republican ticket?', 'Tamara Keith:', ""Well, there are some swing state Democratic governors who could certainly help, the governor of Pennsylvania, for instance, or the governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, who is someone who is actually quite popular in a swing state, if you're being generous."", ""Generally, it's been a Republican state, but he's a Democrat who has won twice with Trump on the ballot. That is a state that has been a reach for Democrats and is something they could be looking for."", ""But I also want to just, like, be realistic about how important the vice presidential pick is. We all love to talk about it. Veepstakes are extremely fun. And it's great to play those games and think about scenarios."", 'But, in the end, the president — the nominee is running for president. The vice presidential nominee can only do so much. They can do harm, but they can only help so much.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Amy, you agree with that?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Absolutely. I mean, it helps around the margins.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Yes.', 'Amy Walter:', ""But in an era where everything is decided by the margins, I think that's important."", ""There's also the question about sending a message, not just about the candidate, who they are, where they're from, but what their age is, what their background is. It would be a generational shift to pick somebody like Josh Shapiro, who's in his late 40s, and having Kamala Harris. It would also sort of make a Gen X argument for the Democrats, versus a baby boom presidential candidate on the Republican side."", 'Amna Nawaz:', ""I realize there's still, Amy, some questions ahead. Obviously, Democrats have to work out the rules for the infrastructure moving forward with the nominating process, but you noted as we began this conversation, it was three weeks ago that debate unfolded that led to this whirlwind of activity we have seen in the last few weeks."", 'And we have basically that exact same time to go before the Democratic Convention begins.', 'Amy Walter:', 'Right.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Is the chaos portion of this election cycle over, or is there greater uncertainty ahead?', 'Amy Walter:', ""Yes, I'm never going to say anything's over now."", '(Laughter)', 'Amy Walter:', 'I think we should feel pretty good about that.', ""But I do think we have to — as Tam pointed out, and Laura, the campaign infrastructure itself seems to be settling into place. Basically, they're conveying the Biden campaign to the Harris campaign, but that's going to be an integration that's going to take a little bit of time. I'm sure there are going to be some bumps along the way there."", ""And then Harris has to go out and perform as a candidate. She hasn't had to do that as a candidate since she was on the — well, not even on the trail in 2020, when they were sort of campaigning remotely, and then before that in her failed bid for the nomination."", 'So this is a very different experience that she is going to have to get up to speed on.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Different experience for all of us to cover as well.', 'Amy Walter:', 'Yes.', 'Tamara Keith:', 'Yes.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Tam, very quickly, a couple seconds left. Go ahead.', 'Tamara Keith:', ""Yes, I think it's going to be a race to define Harris between Republicans and the Trump campaign and Harris and her campaign."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'All right, that is Tamara Keith and Amy Walter, our Politics Monday team.', 'Always great to see you both.

In October 2023, Harris sat down with PEOPLE at her home, the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., for a wide-ranging interview. From her marriage to (the first) Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, to her favorite Beyoncé song to her vision for the future, read the full interview below.', 'Kamala Harris is vice president “24/7, 365” as her husband of nine years, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, puts it. But on her 59th birthday on Oct. 20, she was planning on a slightly more relaxed day than usual: after a morning interview and photo shoot with PEOPLE, perhaps a few moments in her vegetable garden — where she likes to pick fresh tarragon for salads — followed by a small gathering with family and close friends. An early summons from the president to report to the Oval Office amid the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza meant that Harris was thrust into action, with her staff scrambling to rearrange her day.', 'Of course, for the highest-ranking woman in U.S. history, birthdays — along with nearly everything else — are a distant second to the job.', 'At the end of each evening, after reading her nightly “binders” of briefing documents (“about this thick,” she explains, placing her hands a foot apart), Harris says she tries to have some “wind-down time.” Still, she admits that the brief respite and a mug of chamomile tea aren’t quite enough.', '“I usually wake up in the middle of the night with some thought of what’s going on,” she says. “Then I fall back asleep, and the next day starts.”', 'YSA PEREZ', 'Restless nights, hurried days, intense pressure: Welcome to Kamala Harris’ world, in which the triple landmark of being the first woman, first Black person and first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president carries an unprecedented combination of scrutiny and expectation.', 'Nearly three years into a role that is notoriously diffuse — “I am vice president. In this I am nothing, but I may be everything,” John Adams famously said — the woman who is a heartbeat away from the most powerful job in the world is determined to take things one day at a time.', 'She is well aware that in a hyperpolarized political culture, the “comments section” of her life draws both praise and vitriol. The latter, which often veers into racism and sexism, is something Harris has navigated throughout her lifelong career in public service. ', '“The strategy is focusing on the people who are there to support you rather than giving your energy to those who may not be,” she says of her approach to managing negativity. “It’s important to have people in your life who will applaud your ambition.” But she is quick to note that included in that group are “people who are very candid with you. Who are going to say to you, ‘Honey, you need a mint.’ ‘You have food in your teeth.’ Right?”', 'ADAM SCHULTZ/OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE PHOTO', 'Harris’ critics, of course, don’t hesitate to point out her perceived slip-ups, from her meme-able “word salads” to deep frustrations with what many see as a lack of impact during her current term.', 'After making history with Joe Biden in 2020 — “We did it, Joe,” she effused in a viral video declaring their winning moment — Harris has seen her favorability rating dip to 39%, slightly less than both Biden and her predecessor Mike Pence, according to recent polling by the Los Angeles Times.', 'Although she has crisscrossed the country, most recently drawing more than 10,000 Gen Z students on her “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” (her favorability among Gen Z holds at almost 60%), she has been accused of low visibility among even her supporters.', 'She has also been tasked with leading the administration’s public stance on immigration, sparking dissent from all sides. At the final stop of her tour at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, a student confronted Harris about “this country’s inhumane [immigration] policies,” drawing a comparison to the treatment of Palestinians and sparking loud applause from the young crowd. (Harris cited her own “lived experience” as the daughter of an immigrant mother for how she approaches the issue.)', 'Experts say that as Republicans and Democrats become increasingly entrenched, those in the White House are unlikely to enjoy the kind of widespread popularity of past administrations. But beyond her traditional role championing the administration’s priorities — including gun safety legislation, reproductive rights and the youth vote — her status as a trailblazer has had an impact that can’t yet be measured either at home or abroad.', 'With a diverse, largely female staff and events often centered on women and girls, Harris is “showing a woman as a national leader of the major country in the world [in ways] no previous vice president has done,” says Joel Goldstein, author and expert in vice presidential history.', 'And what about becoming the first Madam President? It’s not a question she’s interested in addressing at the moment, focusing instead on the 2024 reelection efforts alongside Biden, 80, and remaining fiercely committed to her mantra of “eating no for breakfast.”', '“Some people, frankly, are limited in their ability to understand what’s possible,” she says. “Some people just can’t see what they’ve never seen.

What do the polls say about a Harris vs. Trump matchup?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vNTM4L3BvbGxzLWhhcnJpcy10cnVtcC1tYXRjaHVwL3N0b3J5P2lkPTExMjE2MjE0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"[""What we know and don't know about the potential new presidential contest."", ""The past nine days have featured some of the wildest twists and turns in the history of U.S. presidential elections. On July 13, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt two days before the start of the Republican National Convention. Then yesterday, President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race, an unprecedented move for a sitting president who was his party's presumptive nominee."", ""Biden's exit follows more than three weeks of growing calls among Democratic Party officials, donors and voters for him to consider stepping aside following his woeful performance in the June 27 debate against Trump. His decision leaves a vacant presidential nomination slot for Democrats less than a month before the party gathers in Chicago for its national convention. Yet Biden and many other high-profile Democrats have lined up behind Vice President Kamala Harris, making her unquestionably the most likely post-Biden alternative."", ""Naturally, we wondered how much better or worse Harris has polled against Trump compared with Biden. To get an initial apples-to-apples comparison, we homed in on national- and state-level surveys that separately tested both Harris and Biden against Trump. We also split the polls by whether the pollster conducted the survey before the debate (going back to Jan. 1) or after it, which gave us 24 pre-debate polls and 46 post-debate polls. While Harris consistently polled worse than Biden did against Trump before the debate, since then she's sometimes polled ahead of Biden. In fact, Harris fared the same as or better than Biden in close to half of the post-debate polls: A near-bell curve distribution in the differences between their margins in these polls is centered close to 0, suggesting little to no meaningful difference between how Harris and Biden performed."", ""And it seems that Harris's stronger showing in these later polls is more about her having made up distance on Trump than Biden losing ground. Across nine national surveys before the debate, Harris did about 3 points worse than Biden on average, but in 25 post-debate polls, she's only performed about 1 point worse than Biden on average — even as Biden's margin in the same set of post-debate surveys also got slightly better.* Harris also improved her showing across the swing states, based on a very limited sampling of polls."", ""To be clear, this doesn't mean that Harris will run notably stronger than Biden, only that she could. Her post-debate polls against Trump relative to Biden have a great deal of variance, ranging from around 8 points worse to 4 points better than how Biden performed. Based on an average of 26 national polls conducted over the past month, Harris trailed Trump by 4.5 points nationally compared with a smaller 3-point deficit for Biden."", ""Polling at the state level is limited at this point, with no more than four polls conducted in the past month in any battleground state. But based on the state-level polls we do have, things don't look any more rosy for Harris there, as she lags behind Biden's margin against Trump in the key battleground states for which we have data. In our aggregate of this limited set of polls, Harris trailed Trump by around 3 points in Wisconsin (Biden trailed by about 2 points), by almost 5 in Pennsylvania (Biden was down around 4) and by 5 in Michigan (Biden was behind by about 2). This raises the possibility that she could have a harder time than Biden winning the Electoral College and thus the election."", ""Still, if Harris does end up as her party's nominee, Democrats will hope that her polling improves as she mounts an active campaign against Trump. For one thing, Harris could experience something of a quasi-convention bounce in the wake of the coverage of Biden's departure and her now-active candidacy. Moreover, until Sunday, any poll that tested Harris (or any other possible Democratic candidate) had been hypothetical for survey respondents. That is not the case anymore, which could at least partially reset the race and shift how some voters are thinking about it moving forward. For Democrats, Harris could represent an escape hatch from the doom spiral of negative media coverage that had hounded Biden following the June debate, as well as the heightened concerns about his capacity to serve at 81 years old and fears that he could not recover the momentum against Trump."", ""Ultimately, Harris's seeming upward trend in the polls and the fact that she's polled better than Biden in many recent surveys will give Democrats reason to hope that she has a higher ceiling of support than the president, whose polling numbers had remained pretty stagnant throughout the campaign. This seems especially true because fewer Americans have expressed an opinion about Harris than Biden in approval polling. In theory then, the public has less concrete views about the vice president, which could allow her to win over some voters who didn't want to consider Biden."", 'Of course, that hypothesis needs to be tested on the proving ground of the campaign trail. If nominated, Harris could absolutely end up losing to Trump — after all, the same post-debate polling that suggested she could do better than Biden also pointed to a potentially lower floor of support. But for Democrats who felt like they were slouching toward defeat in November behind a candidate whom voters were increasingly unenthused by, a Biden alternative could shake up the race, excite the party and give Democrats a chance of rebuilding an anti-Trump coalition that could win.', ""*To reiterate the limitations of this analysis, we know that Biden's margin against Trump actually got slightly worse in 538's national polling average right before he dropped out. The post-debate polls that tested both Harris and Biden constitute only about one-third of all state and national polls that asked about the general election in the post-debate time frame."", '24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events', '', '', '']"

The most formidable challenge – defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November – is still to come. Her elevation to the top of ticket would bring new strengths for the Democrats, but it also exposes weaknesses that were less of a concern with Mr Biden.', 'According to recent polls, Ms Harris trails the former president slightly – a roughly similar position to the one Mr Biden found himself in before his historic announcement. But there may be more room for those numbers to shift as we move from a hypothetical matchup to a very real one.', 'For at least a moment, Democrats have a jolt of energy after more than three weeks of intense hand-wringing over the president’s fitness and ability to sustain his campaign.', 'All of Ms Harris’s leading potential rivals for the nomination have endorsed her, as has former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi – who remains one of the most influential players in Democratic politics.', 'This is, still, shaping up to be a tight race in November - a condition that reflects deep partisan trenches in American politics and the distaste many voters have for Trump as a candidate.', 'The vice-president’s primary challenge – and opportunity - will be to capitalise on this Trump aversion, attract centrist voters in key swing states and energise the Democratic base, which was in the past few weeks swinging towards despair, to match the enthusiasm many on the right hold for the former president.', 'This renewed sense of Democratic presidential enthusiasm comes with a dollar sign attached. According to the Harris campaign, the vice-president raised more than $80m (£62m) in new donations in the 24 hours since Mr Biden’s announcement – the biggest one-day total of any candidate this election cycle. That, along with the nearly $100m she inherits from the Biden-Harris fundraising coffers, gives her a firm financial footing for the campaign to come.', 'Ms Harris, if she becomes the nominee, also defuses one of the most effective attacks the Republicans have levelled against their opponent: his age.', 'For months, the Trump campaign has been pounding Mr Biden for being feeble and easily confused – characterisations that were reinforced for many Americans after the president’s halting debate performance four weeks ago.', 'The vice-president, at age 59, will be a more energetic campaigner and able to make a more coherent case for her party. She could also turn the 78-year-old Trump’s age against him, as he would become the oldest person ever elected president.', 'Ms Harris may also be able to shore up support from black voters, who polls indicate had been drifting away from Mr Biden in recent months. If she can combine that with more backing from other minorities and younger voters – Barack Obama’s winning coalition from 2008 and 2012 – it could help her gain ground against Trump in the handful of swing states that will decide this year’s election.', 'Her background as a prosecutor could also burnish tough-on-crime credentials. While her law-enforcement resume was a liability when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 – and led to derisive “Kamala is a cop” attacks from the left – it could help her in a campaign against Trump.', 'The vice-president has also been the administration’s point person on abortion, which has proven to be one of the most potent issues for motivating the Democratic base in recent elections. Mr Biden, by contrast, sometimes had been a reluctant advocate on the issue, hampered by a past record of supporting some limits on the procedure.', ""“I think she reminds suburban women across the country, particularly in those battleground states, of what's at stake with reproductive rights,” former New York congressman Steve Israel, who headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told the BBC’s Americast podcast."", '""We have established a fundamental reset in the campaign.”', 'For all Harris’s potential strengths, there is a reason why some Democrats were initially reluctant to push Mr Biden to step aside, given that his running mate would be the clear successor.', ""Despite generating Democratic enthusiasm on the subject of abortion, Ms Harris's record as vice-president has been mixed. Early in the administration, she was set the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border. A number of missteps and misstatements - including a ham-handed June 2021 interview with NBC News presenter Lester Holt – damaged her standing and opened her to conservative attacks."", ""Republicans are already condemning her as the president’s “border czar”, attempting to make her the face of what public opinion polls have found is the Biden administration's unpopular immigration policies."", '“Immigration is a soft spot for Democrats in those battleground areas,” Mr Israel said. “This is a very salient issue for voters living in those suburbs, fairly or unfairly. They believe that our immigration system is not managed strongly enough.”', 'The Trump campaign will also try to turn the vice-president’s prosecutorial background against her – both by highlighting the former president’s record of enacting criminal justice reform and by attacking her past prosecutorial and parole decisions.', 'Another Harris vulnerability is her chequered track record as a candidate. In her 2016 Senate bid, she faced only token opposition from Republicans in deeply Democratic California.', 'Her one solo run for national office – a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – ended in ruins. While she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primary contests.', 'Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ms Harris is that, unlike the president, she is not the incumbent. While she might have the opportunity to distance herself from some of the more unpopular elements of Mr Biden’s record, she also does not have the luxury of being a known quantity for voters.', 'Expect a furious effort by Republicans to paint Ms Harris as too untested and too risky to be president. In effect, Trump now has a greater claim to being the only proven commodity.', 'The vice-president has a chance, in the days ahead, to make a new first impression with the American public. If she stumbles out of the gate, it could open the door to an extended power struggle that stretches into the Democrat’s national convention in late August. They could end up with the party uniting behind a different candidate – or tearing itself apart.', 'As the past four weeks have shown, fortunes in the White House race can shift quickly and permanently. Ms Harris has punched her ticket to the biggest stage in American politics – now she has to show she can compete.', 'Both parties called on Kimberly Cheatle to resign during a bruising hearing about security lapses that led to the Trump rally shooting.', ""Liberal voters - and one Republican sceptical of Trump - react to Biden's decision to endorse Harris."", 'It’s not a done deal but some potential rivals have quickly thrown their support behind her.', 'The path for a Democratic nominee is less than clear months before the election.', ""The US Vice-President praised Joe Biden's track record as US president."", 'Copyright 2024 BBC.

Tim Walz backs Kamala Harris, as vice presidential speculation grows",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9nb3YtdGltLXdhbHotYmFja3Mta2FtYWxhLWhhcnJpcy1hcy12aWNlLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1zcGVjdWxhdGlvbi1ncm93cy82MDAzODI3OTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who on Monday morning endorsed Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential nomination, has landed on the list of names being floated as her vice presidential nominee.', 'Walz endorsed Harris for president in a post on X, thanking her for a call and pledging his ""full support.""', '""Let\'s go win this thing,"" he wrote.', ""Other possible running mates from a handful of battleground states are seen as more likely picks to run with Harris. But, as the smoke clears from President Joe Biden's weekend decision to leave the race, Walz's rising national profile has put him in the discussion as the party scrambles to put together a unifying ticket ahead of the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago."", ""Prominent Democrats in Minnesota and across the country quickly rallied around Harris following Biden's announcement, which also saw him endorse Harris as his successor. While other Democrats could still challenge Harris as the nominee, much of the party's leadership is lining up behind her, and attention has quickly shifted to who she'll pick to join her on the ticket."", ""Democratic governors top the list of names mentioned most frequently by donors and pundits. That includes Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Roy Cooper of North Carolina, states that voted for Donald Trump but also sent Democrats to the governor's office."", 'Those candidates, along with Walz, could provide demographic and geographic balance to a ticket with Harris, a Black woman and a former attorney general and U.S. senator from California. Governors also come with executive experience that could appeal to Harris.', '""She\'s probably going to want someone who has established credentials. She was a senator, you might think of Walz as balancing that out as a state governor,"" said Kevin Parsneau, a political science professor at Minnesota State University, Mankato.', 'Also reported to be on the list of potential candidates are California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Arizona U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer took herself out of the mix on Monday.', 'The hunt for a running mate will be condensed from the typical few months to just days or weeks, said Brian McClung, who worked for former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty when he was considered as a vice presidential possibility in 2008 and 2012.', '""Ordinarily it\'s a deep dive into anything a potential candidate has ever said or done,"" McClung said. ""It\'s very intensive. They\'re going to need to do several months worth of record compiling and analysis in probably a few days. They really want to know everything so there are no surprises going forward.""', 'With governors, much of the vetting is done in previous campaigns and years of service, McClung added.', ""Walz's profile has been rising nationally since he became chair of the Democratic Governors Association, a role that makes him the fundraising and campaign face helping to elect governors in 11 states this fall. As a Biden campaign surrogate for months, he's frequented cable news shows and traveled across the country to promote the president's record."", 'A veteran and former teacher who represented a conservative southern Minnesota district in Congress for a dozen years, Walz has earned a reputation as a more progressive Democrat as governor. He signed a historic number of Democratic priorities into law in 2023 with a one-vote DFL majority in the Legislature.', '""When I travel, a lot of states like what we\'re doing here and I think that idea that we could do that in other places would be great,"" Walz said Monday on MPR News, signaling openness to conversations about being the vice presidential nominee.', '""If I thought there was something that I could bring to the ticket and make a difference, especially in those states we need to win, I\'m certainly listening,"" Walz said.', 'U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, in calling for Biden to leave the race last week, endorsed a Harris-Walz ticket, arguing Harris will need a ""strong Midwestern running mate."" A Wall Street Journal reporter posted on X Monday night that Walz was among a group of governors that the Harris campaign asked for vetting materials.', ""Several national forecasters shifted Minnesota to potentially more favorable to Republicans following Biden's debate performance, but the state hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1972 and is still not seen as a top-tier target for the party this fall."", ""Walz's broader strength with labor unions and Midwestern voters in rural areas could have appeal for Harris, said Cindy Rugeley, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Meanwhile, a candidate like Cooper in North Carolina or Kelly in Arizona could help deliver states where Trump had been polling ahead."", '""She\'s being pragmatic. She wants somebody who can do the job if anything should happen to her. She\'s also looking at winning and she\'s maybe looking to expand the map with this choice,"" Rugeley said.', 'The personal relationship between the two candidates is also crucial, McClung said.', '""When you\'re going to be thrown into the mix with about 100 days left in the election, having somebody that you are on the same page with, that you trust and respect"" is important, he said.', ""As co-chair of the rules committee for the convention, Walz will be at the center of conversations going forward no matter what. He'll help determine how the nomination process proceeds without Biden."", ""Even if Walz is not near the top of the vice president short list now, McClung said a lot can change over the course of conversations with candidates, party leaders and donors. Pawlenty wasn't initially high on the list in 2008, but ended up as the runner-up behind former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin."", '""Clearly Democrats are going to need to perform in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania,"" McClung said. ""Someone with Midwestern roots who understands what the economy is like in those states could have a lot of appeal to the Harris campaign.""', '', '', 'Briana Bierschbach is a politics and government reporter for the Star Tribune.', '', '', '© 2024 StarTribune.

For the most part, Democrats in leading positions have been quick to follow the president’s lead and circle the wagons around his heir apparent.', 'Other leading figures, though, wary of appearing as if they were “coronating” Harris, kept their powder dry.', 'Former President Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, in a joint statement, said that they were “honored” to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.”', '“Now is the time,” the Clintons added, “to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her. America’s future depends on it.”', 'Leaders of nearly all House Democrats’ power centers lined up behind Harris. Rep. Annie Kuster, chair of the vast, moderate New Democrat caucus, gave Harris her “full-throated endorsement.” Further to the left, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal said she looked forward to Harris becoming “the first South Asian American and first Black woman to serve as President of the United States of America.” Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Nanette Barragán endorsed Harris, as did the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus, which had been one of the last bulwarks of support for Biden since the disastrous June presidential debate.', 'Rank-and-file members and senators across the board, from Sens. Mark Warner and Chris Coons to Reps. Ilhan Omar and Jamaal Bowman, were falling in line at a rapid clip throughout Sunday afternoon.', 'You’ll notice some other major Democratic names, though, missing from this list. And there’s something that they all have in common.', 'Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said in her statement, “President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history.', '“God blessed America,” she added, “with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”', 'Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was similarly reverential, saying, “America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace, and dignity. We are forever grateful.”', 'And Biden’s old boss, former President Barack Obama, paid his respects by writing an article-length statement rather than a couple of nice sentences. In regard to the path forward, Obama said, he had “extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges. I believe that Joe Biden’s vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August.”', 'What do these four—who did not explicitly endorse Harris—have in common? Well, they’re all at severe risk of being dropped from Biden’s Christmas card list this year, as these were the four leaders who appeared to do the most work behind the scenes to nudge Biden out of the race.', 'Since they are already facing some backlash from the minority of Democrats who wanted Biden to stay on, they don’t want to appear as if they’re also determining the next party nominee. As Politico reported recently, Pelosi was among those in a recent discussion who stressed “the potential political downsides of party elites quickly crowning the vice president as the next nominee.”', 'Harris also recognizes that there would be political downsides to coronating herself. In her statement Sunday, she said she was “honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” In other words, she is not accepting the nomination right now.', '“Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,” Harris added. “And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.”', 'So is Harris’ nomination a lock? What of the fabled miniprimary?', 'It’s worth at least parsing statements from arguably the two other would-be top rivals to Harris for the nomination: California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.', 'Whitmer posted a statement that read: “My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.” And Newsom, in a brief post, said that Biden “will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents.” [Update, July 21, 2024, at 8:11 p.m.: Newsom released another statement later in the day that said, “No one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President, Kamala Harris.”]', 'Neither of those statements endorses Harris. And neither Whitmer nor Newsom has shut the door to their own presidential hopes this cycle either. (Another Bloomberg report said that Whitmer did not “intend” to challenge Harris for the nomination this cycle. Well, I didn’t “intend” to be working on a Sunday afternoon, but here we are.)

She did run a bad race. There are a couple of lessons to be learned from it. For starters, she should make sure her best debate zinger—aimed, remember, at Joe Biden—is not a defense of a deeply unpopular 50-year-old policy (busing) that, a few days after the debate, her aides could not defend. So there’s that.', 'However, I’d argue today that that race is largely irrelevant to this one, assuming she’s the candidate (which I’ll discuss a bit below, but which I do believe we can assume). There are a couple of key reasons why.', 'First of all, she doesn’t have to build this campaign from the ground up. The Biden campaign has a staff of thousands in place. Some of them won’t want to work for Harris, but I’d imagine most of them will. Granted, she’ll need to bring in her top people, and that’s an important job. But she won’t have to hire, say, a whole fundraising staff. She won’t have to execute contracts with vendors. All that’s done, and I hope we can presume that the people in those jobs are experienced and reasonably competent.', 'And second, and actually more important, this is not a primary against 17 like-minded people where you have to strain to stand out. That was a marathon where it was hard to get attention. This is a sprint where the attention is going to be automatic and intense. To the extent that she isn’t now, she’ll be nationally known in a matter of days, and assuming the polls are correct and Harris is as close to Donald Trump as Joe Biden was (or even closer), she already has 75 million votes in her pocket. She just needs to win those final seven or eight million.', 'So no: She’s not one of 100 senators scrambling to generate buzz in a crowded primary field. She’s the likely Democratic Party standard-bearer. And two other things: She’s not 81, and she’s not Trump. For a lot of people, that’s all she needs to be.', 'But not, of course, for everyone. Here there are two main groups of concern. The first, I wrote about last week: the Biden diehards who wanted the president to stay in the race. They were as of last week an angry bunch, and they’re probably angrier still this week. It will be largely up to Biden to calm them down and tell them to follow his example and do what’s right for the country here. But it will also be the job of all the leading Democrats to lavish praise on Biden and turn this moment—which, let’s face it, holds great potential for chaos and disarray—into a moment when the party finds a surprising and extraordinary unity.', 'The next group consists of those who want an open primary process. That includes me, at least in my dream world—one in which Biden had made his decision in time for a six-week mini-primary before the convention, which starts on August 19. But Biden demurred, and now it’s too late for that.', 'And Biden has endorsed Harris. Can anyone else still get in? Sure, of course. And maybe some will. There may be statement candidacies of some sort from both the center and the left. But it’s unlikely that any of the big governors are going to jump in. So the open-process devotees are just going to have to come to terms with this. It’s going to be Harris.', 'It’s going to be Harris, and it’s going to have to be a galvanized and unified effort like none we’ve ever seen. I have my reservations about her. So do you. So do we all. She has pretty high negatives. She might prove to be a bad campaigner. She doesn’t, as I’ve written, appear to have a natural passion for economic policy. I could go on.', 'But we just need to wrap our heads around this right now. It seems 90 percent likely that she’s going to be the Democratic nominee. And the Democrats need to embrace it and line up and move heaven and earth to make her a winner.', 'And the man who can be the Leonard Bernstein of that orchestra is of course the man who just became the second American Cincinnatus. Joe Biden stepped forward to save the country from Trump in 2020, and now, in 2024, he steps back, willingly giving up power, to save the country from Trump again. Tuesday at the Democratic convention had better be Joe Biden Day, and they better put on the show that the man deserves. His decision Sunday will go down in American history, and if Harris (or a different Democrat) ends up winning in November, it’ll be worthy of a painting in the Capitol Rotunda someday. Perhaps unveiled by the first Black woman president.

In one term, he has already …,” Harris said in a speech on the White House South Lawn, before stopping mid-sentence to add, “Yes, you may clap.”', 'Harris delivered her trademark laugh — often described by detractors as a cackle — while pausing at the event honoring the men’s and women’s NCAA championship teams.', 'The vice president spoke to the teams in Biden’s absence as he recovers from COVID-19 at his Delaware vacation home, from which he tweeted Sunday afternoon that he would retire and back Harris for the Democratic nomination.', '“Our president, Joe Biden, wanted to be here today. He is feeling much better and recovering fast, and he looks forward to getting back on the road,” Harris, 59, told the student athletes — before launching into a political eulogy for her boss.', '“In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,” she said.', '“I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We worked together as attorneys general in our states, and back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is. The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president: his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big heart and his love, deep love of our country.”', 'Harris added: “I am firsthand witness that every day our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”', 'Many fellow Democrats rallied around Harris shortly after Biden endorsed her, but some party leaders did not immediately bless her as the would-be nominee against former President Donald Trump — including former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).', 'Harris faces an early test of support in early August when Democrats are set to electronically vote for the party’s nominee to meet an Aug. 7 Ohio ballot access deadline.

Harris isn’t her party’s best candidate.

More than 70 percent of voters consider Biden unfit to seek another term in office. His poll numbers in swing states have fallen sharply in recent weeks, while the Democrats’ internal data has shown Trump only narrowly trailing in blue states such as Minnesota, New Mexico, and New Jersey.', 'Plenty of candidates in American history have closed larger polling gaps than Biden’s in a campaign’s last four months. But in recent weeks, the president repeatedly demonstrated a gross inability to effectively communicate, with each public performance generating multiple misstatements or brain freezes that reinforced the public’s doubts about his cognitive functioning.', 'Biden was undoubtedly right to step aside, but the wisdom of his decision to immediately endorse Harris — rather than clearing the way for a more open competition for the nomination at next month’s convention — is less clear.', 'After all, the vice president has many liabilities as a candidate, and the Democrats boast multiple popular swing-state governors whose hypothetical nomination might ease the party’s path to an Electoral College majority. Given the stakes of keeping Trump out of power, Democratic convention delegates may have been justified in picking whichever ticket seemed most likely to bring victory in November.', 'Nevertheless, I think Biden made the right call. If there were some mechanism for instantly achieving party unity around nominating Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — or one of the party’s other top-tier talents — then Democrats would be wise to take it. But no such mechanism exists.', 'Failing to rally around Harris would have left Democrats bereft of a nominee until late August, giving Trump a month to campaign unopposed. And the vice president would have been highly likely to prevail at that convention anyway, given her official status as Biden’s heir apparent and the democratic legitimacy that comes with it.', 'At this point, it is unlikely that the most promising candidates on the Democratic bench would have chosen to compete, given the risks of alienating key constituencies within the party and the widespread sense that Republicans will be favored to win in November, irrespective of whom the Democrats nominate.', 'Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term. And he made another by refusing to bow out swiftly once the debate made his unfitness plain. But on Sunday, he did the best he could to reverse some of the damage. It’s now incumbent on Harris — and all other Democrats — to put together a campaign strong enough to reverse the rest.', 'Before examining why endorsing Harris was (probably) the right call, it’s worth taking stock of the case for an open convention.', 'That argument boils down to three fundamental claims: 1) Harris is not an especially strong candidate, 2) nominating the vice president prevents Democrats from getting a clean break from Biden’s vulnerabilities, and 3) the party has several strong alternative candidates.', 'All these claims seem right to me.', 'Harris currently has a net disapproval rating of roughly negative 12 percent. And her electoral track record is unimpressive. In her first statewide election in 2010, Harris beat a Republican in the race for California attorney general by less than 1 percentage point (two years earlier, Barack Obama had bested John McCain by more than 23 points in that state). In 2020, Harris began her run for the Democratic nomination with strong fundraising and an early surge in the polls. Yet her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.', 'Further, as a Californian whose Senate voting record put her on the left wing of her caucus, Harris is not an ideal figurehead for a party anxious to appeal to Trump-curious Midwesterners.', 'Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.', 'Making matters worse, Harris’s candidacy did not fall out of a coconut tree. It exists in the context of her current boss’s unpopularity and conspicuous cognitive decline. For many voters, Biden has become a byword for inflation and infirmity. A Democratic nominee with no connection to the Biden administration would have given the party distance from both of these liabilities: They would have faced much less of a compulsion to defend Biden’s record, while confronting few questions about their own hypothetical complicity in concealing the president’s frailty.', 'On both these fronts, Harris could find herself saddled with her boss’s baggage.', 'Finally, the Democrats have some formidable politicians on their bench. Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer both boast majority approval in their critical swing states.', 'Democrats would likely be better off with one of those governors as their standard-bearer, all else being equal. But this does not mean that the party would have been better off holding a completely open convention.', 'The problems with withholding endorsements from Harris and pursuing an open convention are threefold.', 'First, the Democratic Party is poorly positioned to organize and legitimize a contested convention. It has been more than half a century since the Democrats chose a nominee through convention wrangling, rather than purely through the primary process. In that time, the institutional structure of the party has dramatically changed.', 'In the mid-20th century, Democratic delegates consisted in no small part of the leaders of trade unions and urban machines — individuals who were directly accountable to mass constituencies. This made it possible for them to credibly speak on behalf of key Democratic voting blocs.', 'Meanwhile, since contested conventions were routine occurrences in American politics at that time, there was a great deal of institutional knowledge about how to broker such competitions and reach consensus.', 'Today, by contrast, Democratic delegates are largely volunteers who speak for no one beyond the primary voters in their areas. In this context, a contested convention could be chaotic, and its nominee lacking in democratic legitimacy.', 'To be sure, anointing Harris is not especially democratic either. She was not elected by primary voters, any more than any other non-Biden Democrat. But the US electorate did vote to make her the president’s heir apparent, and this gives her a source of legitimacy that any other selection would lack.', 'Second, and more importantly, failing to coalesce behind a nominee today would have left Democrats without a standard-bearer for a month. This would inhibit fundraising, at a time when the Trump-Vance ticket is taking in serious cash. And it would mean ceding swing-state airwaves to the Republican message — or else, running exclusively negative advertising — for the next four weeks. This is especially risky in a context where Democrats face the challenge of introducing a new nominee to the country.', 'As Biden’s default replacement, having been elected to fill in for him in the event of his death or disability, Harris was uniquely capable of becoming her party’s consensus nominee in the absence of a protracted process.', 'Finally, Harris would have been highly likely to win an open convention, anyway. Before Biden dropped out, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn — a highly influential member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) — let it be known that he would favor Harris were Biden to drop out.', 'Due to her uniquely high name recognition, meanwhile, Harris would likely outperform any other individual Democratic candidate in opinion polls. And as such polls, in combination with her title, rendered her the frontrunner for the nomination, various Democratic interest groups would have had an incentive to line up behind her, so as to ensure their influence in the likely Democratic nominee’s hypothetical administration.', 'Assuming that congressional caucuses, Democratic interest groups, and poll respondents did indeed all indicate their preference for Harris, Democratic delegates would almost certainly have felt compelled to back her.', 'Most critically, it seems unlikely that Shapiro, Whitmer, or other top-tier Democratic talents would have entered the fray in any case. For the reasons already stated, any non-Harris candidate would have faced an uphill battle for the nomination. And merely trying to win that nod would have come at the cost of potentially alienating constituencies that they would need to win during a future primary: A white candidate hoping to one day compete in the South Carolina primary might be wise to avoid being the person who tried and failed to block the first African-American vice president from claiming a nomination that was hers to inherit, at least from the perspective of some Black Democratic elected officials.', 'What’s more, even if the gamble of challenging Harris paid off initially, the prize would ultimately have been the mixed-blessing of serving as the Democratic nominee in a year when the Republican ticket is favored. We cannot know exactly how polls and betting markets would have shifted had Democrats endorsed Shapiro or Whitmer. But Republicans have long held an advantage over Democrats this cycle on the issues most important to voters, chief of all inflation and immigration.', 'Given the balance of risks and benefits here, an ambitious and promising younger Democrat might prefer to sit back and position themselves for 2028 or 2032. At the very least, no swing-state Democrat let word of their interest in potentially running leak in the weeks since Biden’s bad debate.', 'Finally, although Harris has weaknesses, she is not devoid of political gifts. At 59, she is young by the standards of American politics. She is an able speaker, whose recent appearances have brimmed with more vitality and coherence than either Biden or Trump have mustered in years. Her recent remarks debunking the GOP’s claims of being the party of “unity” were especially effective.', 'Harris does have a negative approval rating. But it is nevertheless better than Biden’s. And the public’s disapproval of her is less strongly held. As the political consultant Sarah Longwell has reported, voters in focus groups tend to have a negative impression of Harris — but it is just that, an impression, rather than a deep-seated evaluation. They do not know much about her and are aware of that fact.', 'Today, Harris’s political brand is essentially indistinguishable from Biden’s. Many of her detractors may therefore be simply giving pollsters their views of the president. Those who are actually familiar with Harris, meanwhile, may see her through the lens of her 2020 primary campaign, during which she joined many other Democratic candidates in a bidding war for the allegiance of the party’s left wing. Now that she has been vaulted directly into the general election, Harris has the opportunity to reintroduce herself to the public in a manner tailored to the sensibilities of swing voters by, among other things, leaning into her experience as a “smart on crime” prosecutor.', 'Thus, if she can nail her campaign’s rollout, it is possible that Harris would see her numbers significantly improve.', 'Put all of this together and the case for uniting around Kamala is clear: Democrats can line up behind Biden’s logical successor today, put an end to their party’s internal chaos, and begin the work of rehabilitating Harris’s image — or they can pursue a path that likely ends with the same outcome, only after a month of internal disorganization, discord, and subpar fundraising.', 'The former isn’t a perfect option, but it was probably the best decision available to the Democrats at this late date. Joe Biden deserves credit for making it.', 'YOU’VE READ 1 ARTICLE IN THE LAST MONTH', 'Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

', '“Joe Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history,” she said. “In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office.”', 'Harris discussed knowing Beau Biden, Joe Biden’s eldest son who died of cancer in 2015, when they served as attorneys general of California and Delaware, respectively. ', '“The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president — his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big heart and his love, deep love of our country,” Harris said. “And I am firsthand witness that every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”', 'After Biden’s announcement he would drop out Sunday, Harris issued a statement saying she intends “to earn and win the nomination” to be the Democratic Party’s official candidate for president. Should she do so, she would be the first Black and the first South Asian woman to secure a presidential nomination from either major party.  ', '“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,” Harris said. “And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.” ', 'Harris was set to travel to the formerly Biden, now Harris, campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware on Monday afternoon, the White House said. Also Monday, the campaign announced it had raised $81 million in its first 24 hours.', 'Biden’s announcement came three and a half weeks after his halting and unsteady debate performance against former President Donald Trump, which spurred widespread panic among Democrats and calls from dozens of elected officials, donors and pundits for Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee. ', 'Because Biden dropped out before the Democratic National Convention (DNC), Democratic delegates are free to vote for other candidates, including Harris. Delegates will formally vote to select a new nominee either before or during the DNC, which will take place from August 19-22 in Chicago. ', 'Dozens of top Democrats, members of Congress and major organizations echoed Biden’s endorsement of Harris on Sunday as state parties mobilized ahead of the convention. Nearly 200 congressional and statewide elected officials and more than 250 Democratic mayors have endorsed Harris. On Monday morning, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, two names floated as potential running mate picks for Harris, joined in in endorsing her.', 'Tennessee Democrats became the first to formally pledge delegates to Harris, Reuters first reported.', 'Hendrell Remus, chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, told The 19th that in a previously scheduled delegation meeting, 70 delegates present out of 72 total voted for a motion to put their support behind Harris. (The two delegates not present were Rep. Steve Cohen, who expressed support for Harris on X, and former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore). ', '“There were no defections or dissension or major backlash,” Remus said in a brief phone interview. “I think we were all ready for this. We are all ready for this process to swiftly wrap up and to move on and to really support Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee.”', 'Harris had held several campaign events and fundraisers over the past weeks on behalf of the Biden campaign, assuaging Democratic voters and donors’ anxieties over Biden’s debate performance. On Thursday, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Harris held a rally slamming Trump’s pick of Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. Before Biden dropped out, the White House said Harris would be traveling to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for a campaign event on Tuesday. It’s set to be her first campaign event as Biden’s anointed presidential candidate and the Democrats’ leading choice.', 'By Sunday evening, the “Biden for President” campaign had filed with the Federal Election Commission to rename itself “Harris for President,” allowing the newly formed Harris campaign to assume control of all funds already raised. As of the end of June, this amount was north of $95 million. Small-dollar donors gave $52 million to Harris’ nascent presidential campaign through the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue as of 10 p.m. Eastern Time, the organization said, with donations pouring in before Harris sent out a fundraising email shortly before 8 p.m. on the way to the $81 million figure announced Monday.', 'Harris, 59, served as San Francisco district attorney and attorney general of California before being elected to the U.S. Senate from California in 2016. Biden selected her as his running mate when he ran for president in 2020, and their election to the White House made Harris the first woman and first woman of color to serve as vice president. ', 'Throughout her career, Harris has had a special focus on two issues that have been top of mind among many voters in this election cycle: abortion and gun violence. ', 'Harris is a strong supporter of abortion rights, an issue that she’s been far more comfortable openly championing than Biden, a Roman Catholic who personally opposed abortion rights for much of his political career and stumbled talking about the issue in the June 27 debate.', 'Over the past two years, Harris has been a leading voice opposing the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health that overturned the federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade. She has held numerous official and campaign events focused on reproductive rights and in March, became the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic in Minnesota. ', ' Last week in North Carolina, Harris took aim at the Trump-Vance ticket and Project 2025, a more than 900-page blueprint of far-right policies a future Trump administration could enact in a second term. Trump and his campaign have publicly distanced themselves from the effort, led by the Heritage Foundation, though some of its ideas are echoed in the Republican Party’s platform adopted at its convention in Milwaukee.', '“You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are intent on taking reproductive freedoms from the people of America and the women of America — trying to ban abortion nationwide, as they do, and restrict access to IVF and contraception, as their plan calls for,” Harris said Thursday.  ', 'She serves as the head of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, the first-ever such office established by a presidential administration. In this role, she has led national efforts to expand background checks and close gun show loopholes, has been vocal about her support of a federal red flag law, and has made a point of connecting with younger voters on their concerns about the ways in which gun violence has shaped the experiences of their generation. ', 'In March, Harris visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with a group of young adult survivors of the mass shooting that happened there in 2018. During the visit, she announced two proposals to help prevent school shooting incidents. One was the launch of the first-ever National Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) Resource Center, which serves as the first source of federal support for states in enforcing and implementing red flag laws. The other came from her calling on more states to pass red flag laws of their own and making funding and resources available to those that do so through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. ', 'The Office of Gun Violence Prevention has also worked with the Department of Education to encourage messaging about safe firearm storage as a safeguard against school shootings. ', 'Last year, Harris launched the Fight For Our Freedoms college tour, aimed at speaking directly to young voters about some of the most pressing issues for their generation: gun safety, reproductive rights, climate change and voting rights. In March, the Biden-Harris campaign launched a Students for Biden-Harris Initiative, at which time Harris cited the importance of mobilizing young voters in this election cycle.

One percent of voters surveyed said they’d opt for other presidential candidates, while an additional 2% said they were undecided.', 'The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted by the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs between July 9 and 18 — a volatile time in the presidential contest. It came as some senior Democrats intensified their push to drive the 81-year-old Biden from the race and also encompassed parts of the Republican National Convention and the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.', 'Polling numbers could shift now that Biden has stepped aside — and some leading Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and influential South Carolina U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn have already endorsed Harris.', 'Trey Hood, the UGA political scientist who oversaw the survey, noted that when he polled the Trump v. Harris question it was a hypothetical. Sunday’s news, he said, “certainly resets things.”', '', '“There’s going to be many decisions made by different people that are going to interact with one another, and who knows what the effects of all those decisions are going to be,” he said. “We don’t have enough information, including a definitive Democratic candidate, yet to really say a whole lot.”', 'Still, the poll suggests that Harris has ground to make up in Georgia, a crucial political battleground state that Biden narrowly carried four years ago, delivering the state to the Democrats for the first time in nearly three decades. As vice president, she has paid multiple visits to the state this year, shoring up support among Black voters.', '', 'Credit: Hyosub Shin/AJC', 'The AJC poll found that independents, a crucial voting bloc in Georgia, sided with Trump by 11 percentage points. And a majority of respondents, nearly 53%, said they viewed Harris unfavorably, compared with 42% who said they had a favorable impression of her. Only 5% of those surveyed said they didn’t have an opinion. (More than 57% of respondents viewed Biden unfavorably, compared with 41% who saw him favorably.)', 'On the other hand, Harris polled higher than Biden among Democrats and Black voters, who represent the party’s base. (Nearly 92% of Democrats polled said they backed Harris over Trump, compared with Biden’s 86%. Almost 91% of Black respondents said they’d pick Harris rather than Trump, compared with Biden’s 82% share of the vote.)', 'Among the Black voters who say they will support the vice president is Vela McClam Mitchell of Smyrna.', '“She has qualifications. She understands the people. She understands the problems that we are all encountering, and I really think that she has put in the work,” the 69-year-old said. “I’m certain she will be an excellent president.”', 'The AJC poll found that the race between Trump and Biden was closer than it was with Harris. In a head-to-head matchup against the current president, 48% of Georgia voters polled said they’d back Trump, compared with 45% who would vote for Biden and 3% for another candidate. When the pollsters included independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Libertarian Chase Oliver by name, the race moved into a statistical tie between Trump and Biden, with 45% of respondents picking Trump and 42% Biden.', 'Among Democrats, Harris had almost 85% favorability. But there are some within the party who suggested they aren’t yet enthusiastic about her candidacy.', 'Danise Stewart of Roswell would have voted for Biden this fall but wasn’t excited about it. But the 62-year-old white woman, who works in sales and marketing, said she was “not really happy” with the job Harris has done as vice president.', '“I think she should have been down at the border more and done more,” Stewart said. “But I think she’s going to be energized now. And if she can turn back to her tough prosecutor self, I really think that it would do well for the Democrats.”', 'The poll, meanwhile, highlighted a key factor that’s buoyed Trump in Georgia. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans said they’re “very enthusiastic” about Trump’s chances. Hood, the UGA pollster, said that if Democrats can’t bridge that enthusiasm gap, “that could be enough to put Trump over the finish line in Georgia in this close contest.”', 'Among all voters surveyed, 50% said they viewed Trump unfavorably, and 48% said they had a favorable impression.', 'John Lamie, a disabled veteran from Quitman, has voted for Trump twice and says he will likely do so again this fall. Even though “Trump may not be the best person in the world,” Lamie doesn’t think Democrats will have enough time to adequately introduce a candidate to voters in time.', '“I’m only going to have, what, four months to get to know them? You need to know someone intimately and know what they stand for before voting for them for president,” the Republican said.', 'With Biden out of the race, Trump now becomes the country’s oldest-ever presidential nominee. But fewer than one-third of Georgia voters said they were concerned about the 78-year-old’s age, with more than 90% of Republicans answering that they’re “not too concerned” or “not concerned at all.” Meanwhile, two-thirds of likely Georgia voters said they were concerned that Biden, 81, was “too old” to be president, including 45% of Democrats.', 'The poll shows that Georgians are divided over the other leading political figures. About one-quarter of Georgia voters surveyed have a unfavorable impression of U.S. Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, while one-fifth give him positive reviews. The rest — about 54% — don’t know enough to have an impression.', 'And voters are split over Kennedy, with about 40% of respondents holding a positive view of him, 40% having a negative view and the remainder undecided. He polled highest among Republicans, independents and younger voters, while a plurality of Democrats and liberal voters see him unfavorably.', 'Trump is winning more than one-third of independent voters and has 90% Republican backing, while Kennedy’s strongest bloc of support is among liberals, 14% of whom are supporting him.', 'Voters in Georgia felt mixed about the historic nature of a potential Harris nomination to lead the Democratic Party: She would be the first Black woman and first Asian American to serve as the party’s choice for president.', 'To Portia Kendrick, 54, that’s not enough to garner her support. Although Kendrick is a Black woman, she said she would not vote for Harris.', '”The presidency is about more than race.

4 leading Democrats emerge as possible running mates for Kamala Harris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsYnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMjIvNC1sZWFkaW5nLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1lbWVyZ2UtcG9zc2libGUtcnVubmluZy1tYXRlcy1rYW1hbGEtaGFycmlzL9IBb2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsYnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMjIvNC1sZWFkaW5nLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1lbWVyZ2UtcG9zc2libGUtcnVubmluZy1tYXRlcy1rYW1hbGEtaGFycmlzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['(AP) - No one knows the importance of selecting the right running mate better than Vice President Kamala Harris. With Harris now the leading candidate to succeed President Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, here’s a look at the top contenders to be on the ticket.', 'The Kentucky governor secured his reputation as a rising party star by beating Donald Trump-endorsed candidates in a Republican stronghold.', 'Beshear displayed a disciplined, tenacious style in winning reelection last year by defeating then-Attorney General Daniel Cameron. The governor has urged Democrats to follow his winning formula by focusing on the everyday concerns of Americans, from good-paying jobs to quality education and health care.', 'Beshear, 46, supports abortion rights, but in Kentucky, he has tailored his message to push back against what he calls an extreme ban that lacks exceptions for rape and incest victims.', 'He won widespread praise for his empathy and attention to detail in guiding the Bluegrass State through the COVID-19 pandemic and leading the response to tornadoes and flooding that caused massive damage. He honed his speaking skills by holding regular news conferences that often last an hour or so.', 'Beshear has presided over record economic growth in Kentucky, and he typically begins his briefings by promoting the state’s latest economic wins. He frequently mentions his Christian faith and how it guides his policymaking.', 'A lawyer by trade, Beshear won election as state attorney general in 2015. He then unseated Trump-backed Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019.', 'Beshear entered politics with a strong pedigree as the son of two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, but has faced tougher political obstacles. Andy Beshear, unlike his father, has dealt with an entirely GOP-controlled Legislature and Republican lawmakers have stymied some of his priorities. One of them is state-funded preschool for every Kentucky 4-year-old.', '— By Bruce Schreiner', 'The North Carolina governor has won six statewide general elections over two decades in a state where Republicans routinely prevail in similar federal races and also control the legislature.', 'Cooper, 67, has received strong job-approval ratings as governor, benefiting from a booming state economy for which his administration and lawmakers take credit. He also portrays himself as a fighter for public education and abortion rights. While Cooper finally persuaded GOP legislators last year to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, other efforts have been thwarted by a General Assembly with veto-proof majorities that has eroded his formal powers.', 'A native of small-town Nash County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Raleigh, Cooper was a high school quarterback and head of the Young Democrats at the University of North Carolina, where he obtained both his undergraduate and law degrees. “Coop,” as he was known to friends, came home and worked at his father’s law firm.', 'Cooper upset the Democratic incumbent in a 1986 state House primary race and was elected to the General Assembly. He served 14 years there and later became the Senate majority leader.', 'Cooper was elected attorney general in 2000, a position he held for 16 years. In that post, he is likely best known nationally for declaring three former Duke University lacrosse players innocent after they were accused of sexual assault by an escort service dancer.', 'Cooper unseated another incumbent in 2016, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, by roughly 10,000 votes. A top campaign issue was the “bathroom bill” that McCrory signed requiring transgender people to use public restrooms that corresponded with the sex on their birth certificates. As governor, Cooper quickly reached an agreement with legislators to partially repeal the law.', 'His time as governor also was marked by restricting business and school activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. He won reelection in 2020 by 4.5 percentage points even as Trump won the state’s electoral votes.', 'Cooper and his wife, Kristin, have three grown daughters.', '— By Gary Robertson', 'The Arizona senator leveraged his career as an astronaut to build a brand as a moderate in a state that long supported Republicans.', 'In his two campaigns — the first in 2020 to finish the term of the late Republican Sen. John McCain and the second two years later for a full term — Kelly has earned more votes than any other Democrat on the ballot. He outpolled Biden, who narrowly won Arizona, by 2 percentage points in 2020.', 'Kelly’s first turn in the national political spotlight came through tragedy. His wife, then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in the head while meeting with constituents outside a grocery store in Tucson. The shooting left six people dead and spawned an early reckoning with political violence and partisan rancor.', 'Giffords’ survival made her a national inspiration but snuffed out a promising political career of her own. She and Kelly went on to found a gun-control advocacy group, and Giffords has been a powerful surrogate as Kelly has taken her place in politics.', 'In the Senate, Kelly has focused on national security and the military as well as the drought plaguing the U.S. West. He was instrumental in crafting the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill signed by Biden to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.', 'Kelly was a Navy test pilot and flew 39 combat missions during the Gulf War before joining NASA, where he flew three missions on the space shuttle.', 'Originally from New Jersey, he settled with Giffords in Tucson after retiring from NASA and the Navy.', 'Unlike Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat two years before Kelly but later left the party to become an independent, Kelly has managed to retain the support of the party’s grassroots base without alienating independent voters.', '—By Jonathan J. Cooper', 'Shapiro is halfway through his second year as Pennsylvania’s governor after easily winning his last election by trouncing a far-right, Trump-endorsed candidate.', 'Shapiro, 51, has been a surrogate for Biden, backing the president in appearances on cable networks, and has years of experience making Trump the focus of his attacks, first as state attorney general and now as governor.', 'He has won three statewide races — two as attorney general, one as governor — with a tightly scripted, disciplined campaign style, offering voters something of a lower-key alternative to the state’s brash political star, Sen. John Fetterman.', 'As governor, Shapiro has begun to shed a buttoned-down public demeanor and become more confident and plain-spoken. In one recent MSNBC appearance, he said Trump should “quit whining” and stop “sh— talking America.”', 'Shapiro, who is Jewish, has aggressively confronted what he viewed as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas.', 'He is a staunch proponent of abortion rights in Pennsylvania and routinely promotes his victories in court against Trump, including beating back challenges to the 2020 election results.', 'He also has positioned himself as a moderate on energy issues in the nation’s No. 2 natural gas state and plays up the need for bipartisanship in the politically divided state government.', '— By Marc Levy', '___', 'Schreiner reported from Frankfort, Kentucky; Robertson from Raleigh, North Carolina; Cooper from Phoenix; and Levy from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.', '', '', 'Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
