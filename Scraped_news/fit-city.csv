The index ranks the nation’s 100 largest cities on 33 personal and community health indicators. The index measures whether people in a city walk and bike to work and how much a city spends on public parks. It also assesses a city's food security, smoking rates, overall mental health and the quality of sleep residents get."", 'This year Arlington, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and Seattle ranked the nation’s three fittest cities, according to the index.', ""Shantanu Agrawal, chief health officer of Elevance Health, said a community's environment and the social support it provides greatly influence the overall health of individuals."", '""If people don\'t have the right environment around them, whether it\'s the built environment or access to mental health services, food services, whatever the case may be, that\'s going to affect your health and health outcomes,"" Agrawal said.', ""In a study last month, the World Health Organization warned that since 2010 a growing number of adults aren't getting enough exercise. A lack of physical activity puts people at risk of heart attacks and strokes, Type 2 diabetes, dementia and certain cancers."", 'The American College of Sports Medicine recommends people get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week and muscle-strengthening activity twice a week. The 2024 index found that only 51% of adults met the aerobic activity recommendations, and just 24% met both the aerobic and strength activity goals. ', ""Exercise professionals say they'd like 80% of adults to meet the weekly aerobic activity threshold, according to ACSM President Stella Volpe. She said the purpose of the index is to remind community leaders about the importance of fostering overall community health. That might include investing in hiking and biking trails, public parks or pedestrian-friendly places. As such, the fitness index highlights a community's built environment slightly more than individuals' health habits."", '""We want to look at communities because that\'s what we feel impacts public health and why people might get out more,"" Volpe said.', ""Arlington, Virginia ranked as the nation's fittest city for the 7th consecutive year. The Northern Virginia county ranked first in community and environmental indicators and fourth in personal health indicators. Among Arlington's strengths: nearly 88% of residents said they had exercised in the previous month."", ""Volpe said Arlington's abundant outdoor activities reminded her of the lifestyles she'd observed on a recent trip to the Netherlands."", '""When I think of a city like Arlington, it does have that culture,"" Volpe said. She said the city\'s built environment – parks, bike paths and walking trails – feed into an overall culture of health.', ""Arlington also scored well on other measures: 76% of residents get at least seven hours of sleep per night and just over 3% of residents smoke, the nation's lowest rate, according to the report."", ""Washington D.C., just steps across the Potomac River from Arlington, is the index's second-fittest city. The fitness index ranks municipalities, so multiple jurisdictions within a metropolitan region vie for themselves."", ""Residents of the nation's capital scored high marks for eating their fruits and vegetables. Nearly 38% of residents consumed two or more fruits a day − the highest rate among the 100 cities. And more than 21% of Washingtonians said they eat three or more servings of vegetables per day, the second highest rate."", 'Washington residents also ranked among the top five cities for people getting exercise, using public transportation and biking or walking to work.', ""Volpe said Washington and Arlington are walkable cities that have good public transportation and safe biking lanes, allowing people to exercise when they're commuting."", '""We forget about active transport,"" Volpe said. ""We\'re walking to work, biking to work or we\'re walking to the public transportation that will take us to work,"" and often walking from the train or bus station to the office.', 'Seattle, the third fittest city, residents had the third-highest rate of exercising. The city also ranked third for its public spending on parks. Other cities in the top 10 include San Francisco; Madison, Wisconsin; Minneapolis; Denver; Atlanta; Irvine, California; and St. Paul, Minnesota.', 'Oklahoma City ranked at the bottom of the list. And Port St. Lucie, Florida; Memphis; Wichita; and North Las Vegas were among the bottom five in the report, which includes 100 individual city rankings.', ""The index also cited the role of mental health in a community's overall health. Nearly 45% of people nationwide reported they were in poor mental health during the previous month. While more were suffering mentally, nearly 38% of respondents said they were in poor physical health."", 'The index noted disparities among people who could not afford to access mental health services. Volpe said the percentage of people reporting poor mental health spiked after the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained steady in the last two years.', 'Exercise can help improve mental health, Volpe said, but she added that people often lack access to care.', '""We need to ensure that people get proper care for mental health,"" Volpe said.', ""Agrawal, from Elevance, said the index evaluates mental health, diet and physical health jointly because they are all related. If someone can't get healthy and nutritious foods, that can create anxiety. People also might eat sugary, processed foods that raise their risk of diabetes."", '""You can\'t choose only to be physically healthy or focus only on mental health,"" Agrawal said because, in the end, you won\'t be fit. \'You\'ve got to focus on all segments of whole health.""']"

America's Fittest Cities: Is Your City in the Top 10?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRobmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhcy1maXR0ZXN0LWNpdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['The latest American Fitness Index rankings show more Americans are walking and biking to work. However, exercise levels, mental health concerns, and overall lack of sleep may be hampering physical health.', ""On July 23, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the Elevance Health Foundation published the 17th annual ACSM American Fitness Index, ranking how well 100 of America's largest cities support healthy, active lifestyles."", ""The Index focuses on three primary areas associated with overall health and well being — the city's design for physical activity and active transportation, healthy food access initiatives, and community mental health services."", 'According to research, communities designed to provide optimal walking and biking access, and those with parks close to where people live, can help residents achieve better health and wellness.', 'In addition, cities with policies that enhance access to mental health services can help residents address conditions such as depression, which could impact physical well-being.', 'The Index results are based on 33 evidence-based indicators. ACSM President Stella Volpe, Ph.D., FACSM, ACSM-CEP, tells Healthnews that the indicators were initially selected by ACSM content experts and other nationally recognized fitness experts who understood the importance of community assets in improving health behaviors and outcomes. The analysts gathered city health indicator values from reputable, regularly updated, publicly available data sources.', 'The indicator values for the cities were ranked, weighted, and combined into a personal health subscore, a community/environment subscore, and a total score. The analysts used these scores to rank cities from the most fit (rank 1) to the least fit (rank 100).', 'Overall, Fitness Index findings showed that more people in the United States are walking and biking to work, spending more money at parks, and experiencing slightly improved food security.', 'However, the 100-city analysis also found that many Americans are not getting enough exercise to meet ACSM standards. These standards recommend that people get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus two days of muscle-strengthening activity per week.', 'In addition, Index results found that fewer individuals sleep seven or more hours per night, and fewer people reported they are in excellent/very good health. The analysis also showed an increase in residents reporting poor physical and mental wellbeing.', '""There are a number of reasons why people are not getting enough sleep, exercising enough, and reporting poorer mental and physical health,"" Volpe tells Healthnews. ""For example, some people may be working a number of jobs and do not have time in their day. Some people may not have access, either financial or physical access (that is, the built environment in their city is not conducive for promoting physical activity), and for some people, it is that they do not enjoy being active.""', '""Movement is walking, gardening, dancing, seated exercises, etc. The accumulation of minutes of physical activity per day is as effective as exercising/being physically active at one time,"" Volpe explains.', 'Moreover, people with sedentary jobs should try to get up and move every 30 minutes or every hour, as prolonged sitting may increase the risk of diabetes and obesity.', 'According to Volpe, lack of sleep and poor mental and physical health are also connected.', '""If people are not getting the proper amount of sleep per night (8 to 9 hours for adults), their risk for diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and obesity increases,"" Volpe says. ""In addition, being physically active has been shown to stave off chronic disease and can help with mental health.""', 'According to the Fitness Index findings, Arlington, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, Washington, were the top three fittest cities.', 'Arlington clinched the number-one spot for several reasons. The city ranked high in community/environmental indicators and had the highest rate of residents exercising in the previous month (87.8%). Data also showed that Arlington had the highest number of residents getting seven or more hours of sleep a night (76.4%) and the lowest smoking rates (3.4%).', 'People living in Washington, D.C., had the highest rate of consuming two or more fruits a day (37.9%) and came in second at consuming three or more vegetables per day (21.4%). Moreover, Washington, D.C., was one of the top five cities for exercising in the previous month, walking or biking to work, and using public transportation.', 'In addition to having the third-highest rate of exercise in the previous month, Seattle, Washington, also had the third-highest park expenditures, at $321 per person.', 'Other top-ranking fit cities were:', 'The top 10 lowest-ranked cities include:', ""While Lexington, Kentucky's rankings jumped up 31 slots and Miami, Florida's rankings improved 26 places to land at the number 13 position, two other cities experienced significant drops in their Fitness Index rankings."", ""For example, Tampa, Florida, fell 21 slots to the 45th position. While the city's community/environmental indicators remained relatively stable, personal health indicators involving sleep duration and perceived health status decreased. A rise in reports of poor physical health and an uptick in obesity, asthma, stroke, diabetes, and pedestrian fatality rates also contributed to Tampa's lower ranking."", 'Moreover, Greensboro, North Carolina, dropped 18 places, landing at number 80 on the Index, likely due to fewer residents reporting seven or more hours of sleep and excellent/very good health. Index results also showed an increase in reports of poor mental well being.', 'Still, the ACSM notes that the biggest reason for a drop in ranking is that some cities scored slightly higher, bumping others down the list.', 'Volpe says that while all health indicators are important, those that focus on helping people be more active, such as city designs that allow for better access to physical activity, are most critical.', '""If people move more, that leads to better personal health indicators, so they all really are intertwined,"" Volpe explains.', 'Moreover, Fitness Index rankings can provide cities with a roadmap of their strengths and highlight areas that need improvement to boost the health of their citizens.', 'Volpe concludes, ""It is not an easy task, and cities need resources to do so, but starting with small changes can go a long way in helping people be more active and lead to improved quality of life.""', 'Your email will not be published.

Arlington is America’s ‘Fittest City’—Again,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybGluZ3Rvbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9hcmxpbmd0b24tdmlyZ2luaWEtYW1lcmljYXMtZml0dGVzdC1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['Community resources, abundant parks and walkability earn the county the top spot for the seventh year in a row.', 'Arlington is the nation’s fittest city for the seventh year in a row, according to researchers with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and Elevance Health Foundation.', 'In fact, the top three spots remain the same this year as they were last year: Washington, D.C. again ranks No. 2 and Seattle rounds out the top three.', 'The 17th annual American Fitness Index, released July 23, evaluated the 100 largest U.S. cities using two main groups of indicators: community and environmental and personal health. Community and environmental factors include the built environment, such as the number and accessibility of parks and bike lanes, while personal health covered how often people exercised, their fruit and vegetable consumption, and sleep habits. Arlington ranked first overall and in community/environmental factors and fourth for personal health behind Seattle, D.C. and San Francisco, respectively.', 'Because ACSM gives the community factors a little more weight than the personal health ones, Arlington claimed the top spot, says ACSM President Stella Volpe.', '“If the city has park systems that are available to people and they’re easy to access, if they have easy-access bike paths or walking paths, they have easy access for people to get public transportation and/or walk to their place of work, those things are going to rank higher,” Volpe says. “Not that we don’t care about the personal health rank, but…we want to see what those cities are doing.”', 'In the personal health category, Arlington had the highest number of residents who reported exercising in the previous month (87.8%) and getting at least seven hours of sleep per night (76.4%), and the lowest amount who smoked (3.4%).', 'One reason why Arlington has earned the top spot since 2017 is consistency, Volpe says. “Part of it is they have the resources,” she says of the county. “Part of it is that they’re keeping it maintained, and the other part of it is—it’s become the DNA of people who live there. It’s part of the culture now.”', 'To continue its winning streak in the next Fitness Index assessment, Arlington could benefit from boosting personal health indicators, Volpe says. The report provides tips such as increasing funding for mental health clinics and organizing community gardens where residents can grow fruit and vegetables.', '“It is pretty impressive that they have held onto it for this long,” she says of the county’s ranking.', 'Nationwide, the study found that people are walking and biking to work more, and cities have made progress on park expenditures and food security, but the number of people getting at least seven hours’ sleep each night decreased, as did reports of excellent or very good health.', 'One reason may be that residents in all 100 cities do not exercise enough to meet ACSM’s minimum standards. It recommends at least 150 minutes per week—or 22 minutes per day—of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and strength training twice a week. On average, 78% of adults in the Fitness Index cities reported exercising in the previous month, but only 51% met both guidelines, Volpe says.', 'Additionally, almost half (45%) of individuals nationally said they had poor mental health in the previous month.', '“I hope the reason we might be seeing more [poor mental health reports] is that people might be reporting it more and being more open to reporting it more,” Volpe says. “Remember that exercise can certainly help improve our mental health. That’s one of the things that we as human beings can do that I know isn’t the be-all [and] end-all for people who have mental health issues, but that’s one thing we can do.”', 'Data shows that even short amounts of physical activity can boost mental health, she adds. That includes walking a dog or dancing during TV commercial breaks.', '“People think exercise means working out and working out means ‘I have to go somewhere and do something…and I have to go at it hard,’” Volpe says. “The best type of activity is the one that they can do and the one that they will do.”', 'Become a digital partner ...', 'Your guide to the people, places, activities, and culture that define Arlington, McLean and Falls Church, Virginia.', 'Company Info', 'About Us\nContact Us\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nWrite for Us', 'Get Our Email Updates', 'Follow Us', 'Copyright © 2024 Greenbrier Media, LLC.
